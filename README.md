## About The Project


The Maybe Pile offers fun way to sift through modern fiction titles and zero in on the books that you want to read, without having to keep seeing the ones you don't.

* Once signed in you will be able to select the genres you are interested in and a tailored collection of books will be pulled from our huge database.
* Next the app will show you a snippet of each books synopsis in turn. You are given the option to pass, or add the book to The Maybe Pile. You must make a decision before can see the next book. 
* Once you've added a few books to The Maybe Pile you can view these and find more information about them as well as a direct link to purchase from one of the UK's most recognised book specialists.
* Once you've seen a particular book, you wont be shown it again, so using The Maybe Pile app is a great way to whittle out the no no's in hope of stumbling across something thats not just a maybe but a resounding YES!

## Important Info

This Repository contains the prototype of a product that is now being developed sparately to this version.

It was always the intention for this particuar repository to be a place to play and experiment and once a proof of concept had been obtained I moved on to production under much stricter rules. 
As such this repo is no longer updated or contributed to and has been left here as a demonstration of an idea rather than a working repository. 
 
 You are welcome to download the code and have a play with the concept if you like but please dont try to commit to this particular project as it has been locked.

If you'd like to get in touch then please feel free to contact me on the email address above.
