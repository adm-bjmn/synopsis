Frank and Fearless: A Life in Boxing (Hardback),Frank Warren,"The story of my life would be a bloody sight shorter if the man who tried to murder me outside the Broadway Theatre in Barking on a winter's evening in 1989 had succeeded. He nearly did.Frank Warren has spent forty years working with boxing's most colourful and controversial characters. In his long-awaited autobiography, he reflects on the battles he had to win to reach the top and remain there, not least the battle to stay alive after he was shot at point-blank range in an attempted assassination in 1989.In Frank and Fearless, Warren pulls no punches, taking us behind the scenes into a world of blood and sweat, and intense relationships that all too often end in tears. Under Warren's careful stewardship, Frank Bruno, Naseem Hamed, Joe Calzaghe, Ricky Hatton, Amir Khan and Tyson Fury all became world champions. So did Terry Marsh, the man who was later accused, and cleared, of trying to murder him. Along the way, Warren has been assaulted in a hotel room by the formidable Mike Tyson and gone toe to toe in a court room with his erstwhile partner, the flamboyant Don King.However, boxing is only part of the story that begins on a council estate in 1950s North London, where Warren first learnt how to stand up to bullies. That was how he overcame and outwitted the powerful cartel that controlled British boxing and tried to stop his career before it started, and it is why he is still around to reflect on his remarkable life.With cameo appearances from Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Pink Floyd and the Philadelphia mafia, Frank and Fearless is the unflinchingly candid and hard-hitting memoir of Britain's most famous and influential boxing promoter.",2023-06-15,"['biography', 'truestories', 'sportbiographies', 'sportautobiographies', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'generalbiography', 'generalautobiography', 'biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/frank-and-fearless/frank-warren/9781472126528,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4721/9781472126528.jpg

On the Origin of Time: Stephen Hawking's Final Theory (Hardback),Thomas Hertog,"Stephen Hawking's closest collaborator offers the intellectual superstar's final thoughts on the cosmos - a dramatic revision of the theory he put forward in A Brief History of Time. Perhaps the biggest question Stephen Hawking tried to answer in his extraordinary life was how the universe could have created conditions so perfectly hospitable to life. In order to solve this mystery, Hawking studied the big bang origin of the universe, but his early work ran into a crisis when the math predicted many big bangs producing a multiverse - countless different universes, most of which would be far too bizarre to ?harbour life. Holed up in the theoretical physics department at Cambridge, Stephen Hawking and his friend and collaborator Thomas Hertog worked on this problem for twenty years, developing a new theory of the cosmos that could account for the emergence of life. Peering into the extreme quantum physics of cosmic holograms and venturing far back in time, they were startled to find a deeper level of evolution in which the physical laws themselves transform and simplify until particles, forces, and even time itself fades away. This discovery led them to a revolutionary idea: The laws of physics are not set in stone but are born and co-evolve as the universe they govern takes shape. As Hawking's final days drew near, the two collaborators published their theory, which proposed a radical new Darwinian perspective on the origins of our universe. On the Origin of Time offers a striking new vision of the universe's birth that will profoundly transform the way we think about our place in the order of the cosmos and may ultimately prove to be Hawking's greatest legacy.",2023-04-06,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'popularscience', '', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'mathematics', 'science', 'astronomy', 'space', 'time', 'cosmology', 'theuniverse', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'mathematics', 'science', 'physics', 'appliedphysics']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/on-the-origin-of-time/thomas-hertog/9781911709084,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/9117/9781911709084.jpg

Sweet Enough: A Baking Book (Hardback),Alison Roman,"Casual, effortless, chic: these are not words you'd use to describe most desserts. But before Alison made recipes so perfect that they go by one name - The Cookie, The Pasta, The Lemon Cake - she was a restaurant pastry chef who spent most of her time learning to make things the hard way. She studied flavour, technique, and precision, then distilled her knowledge to pare it all down to create dessert recipes that feel special and approachable, impressive and doable. In Sweet Enough, Alison has written the book for people who think they don't have the time or skill to pull off dessert. Here, the desserts you want to make right away, you can make right away. Alison shows you how to make simple yet sublime sweets with her trademark casualness, like how to make jam in the oven, then turn that jam into a dessert - swirled into ice cream or folded into easy one-bowl cake batter (opening a jar of jam is more than fine, too). She waxes poetic on the virtues of frozen fruit and teaches you the best way to throw your own Sundae Party. There are effortless cakes that take just minutes to get into a pan. And there are new, instant classics with a signature Alison twist, like Salted Lemon Pie, Raspberries and Sour Cream, Toasted Rice Pudding, or a Caramelised Maple Tart. Requiring little more than your own two hands and a few mixing bowls, the recipes are geared towards those without fancy equipment or specialty ingredients. Whether you're a dedicated baker or, better yet, someone who doesn't think they are a baker, Sweet Enough lets you finish any dinner, any party, or any car ride to a dinner party with a little something wonderful and sweet.",2023-04-06,"['food', 'drink', 'tv/celebritychefcookbooks', '', 'food', 'drink', 'cookerydishes', 'courses', 'desserts', 'food', 'drink', 'cakes', 'baking', 'icing', 'sugarcraft']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/sweet-enough/alison-roman/9781743799475,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7437/9781743799475.jpg

Fatal Legacy - Flavia Albia (Hardback),Lindsey Davis,"An unpaid bar bill leads Flavia Albia to her most bitter and complex case yet. Decades earlier Appius Tranquillus Surus wrote his will: it freed his slaves and bequeathed his businesses to them. He left an orchard to the Prisci, a family he was friendly with, on the condition that his freedmen could still take its harvest. The convoluted arrangement has led to a feud between the two families, each of which has its own internal strife. Endless claims and counterclaims lead to violence and even death. Lawyers have given up in exasperation as the case limps on. The original will has disappeared, along with a falsified codicil - and might there be another one?But is there a solution? Two youngsters from each side of the divide, Gaius Venuleius and Cosca Sabatina, have fallen in love, which could unite the feuding families. There is only one problem: were Sabatina's grandmother and father really liberated in the Surus will? If not, the stigma of slavery will stop the marriage and the dispute will rage on forever.Reconciliation seems impossible, but Albia will try. Her investigation must cut through decades of secrets, arguments, lies and violence to reach a startling truth.Praise for Lindsey Davis and the Flavia Albia series'It positively crackles with knowledge of the city and its people, mixed with social comment, ingenious and bloody plots and sharp observational skills leavened by more than a smattering of genuine and sometimes earthy humour' Crime Review'Fiendishly twisted mystery' Mail on Sunday'Great fun, shot through with sharp observations' SHOTS'In this witty novel by the mistress of Roman crime, the reader is transported behind the scenes of a Triumph into a fascinating world of actors, costumiers and animal trainers, all united in their hatred of the murdered man' Sunday Express Magazine",2023-04-06,"['crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'crime', 'mystery', 'historicalmysteries', '', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'crime', 'mystery', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'thrillers']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/fatal-legacy/lindsey-davis/9781529354737,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5293/9781529354737.jpg

"The Throne: 1,000 Years of British Coronations (Hardback)",Ian Lloyd,"In all, thirty-nine coronations have been held in Westminster Abbey, beginning with Harold II on 6 January 1066. Only two monarchs - Edward V and Edward VIII - were uncrowned, and a further twenty or so Scottish monarchs were crowned usually at either Scone Abbey or Holyrood Abbey. In The Throne, Ian Lloyd will turn his inimitable, quick-witted style to these key events in British royal history, providing fascinating anecdotes and interesting facts: from William the Conqueror's Christmas Day crowning when jubilant shouts were mistaken by his guards as an assassination attempt to the dual coronation of William and Mary in 1689, and from the pared-back 'Half Crown-ation' of William IV to the televised spectacle of Elizabeth II's 1953 ceremony. With the spectacle of the first coronation in seventy years promised in May 2023, Lloyd also introduces key elements of the service, such as the Coronation Chair made for King Edward I and the famously uncomfortable Gold State Coach, as well as changes in the Crown Jewels over the centuries. This will be a bright, accessible celebration of British culture and the ultimate pomp of royalty.",2023-04-06,"['history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'royalbiographies', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'britain', 'ireland']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-throne/ian-lloyd/9781803992860,https://cdn.waterstones.com/override/v1/large/9781/8039/9781803992860.jpg
