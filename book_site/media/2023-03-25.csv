Lost in the Lakes: Notes from a 379-Mile Walk in the Lake District (Hardback),Tom Chesshyre,"From Penrith to Ullswater, via Keswick, Cockermouth, Coniston, Grasmere and Windermere, plus many places in between, Tom Chesshyre puts on his walking boots and sets forth along the trails, drawn onwards by the dramatic scenery that attracts more than 19 million visitors each year. Across landscape that so inspired the Romantic poets, he takes in remote parts of the parkland that many tourists miss - enjoying encounters aplenty with farmers, fell runners and fellow hikers, while staying in shepherds' huts, bothies and old climbers' hotels along the way, and even going for a (chilly) dip in Derwentwater. This is the Lake District seen from its walking paths - with just a backpack, an open mind... and a spring in the step.",2023-04-13,"['travel', 'maps', 'travelwriting', '', 'travel', 'maps', 'activeoutdoorpursuits', 'walking', 'hiking', 'trekking']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/lost-in-the-lakes/tom-chesshyre/9781800075191,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8000/9781800075191.jpg

The Survivor: How I Survived Six Concentration Camps and Became a Nazi Hunter (Hardback),Josef Lewkowicz,"One of the last great untold stories of the Holocaust, The Survivor is an astonishing account of one man's unbreakable spirit, unshakeable faith, and extraordinary courage in the face of evil. At only sixteen years old, Josef Lewkowicz became a number, prisoner 85314. Following the Nazi invasion of Poland, he and his father were separated from their family and herded to the Krakow-Plaszow concentration camp. Forced to carry out hard labour in brutal conditions, and to live under the constant threat of extreme violence and sudden death, before the war was over Josef would witness the unique horrors of six of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Ebensee. From salt mines to forced marches, summary executions to Amstetten, where prisoners were used as human shields in Allied bombing, Josef lived under the spectre of death for many years. When he was liberated from Ebensee at the end of the war, conditions were amongst the worst witnessed by allied forces. With his freedom, Josef returned home to find that he was the only one left alive in an extended family of 150. Compelled by the need to do something to avenge that loss, he joined the Jewish police while still in a displaced persons' camp, and was recruited as an intelligence officer for the US Army who gave him a team to search for Nazis in hiding. Whilst rounding up SS leaders, he played a critical role in identifying and bringing to justice his greatest tormentor, the Butcher of Plaszow, Amon Goeth, played by Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List. He then committed his life to helping the orphaned children of the Holocaust rebuild their lives. The Survivor is Josef's extraordinary testimony.",2023-03-30,"['history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'genocide', 'ethniccleansing', 'theholocaust', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', 'history', 'militaryhistory', 'secondworldwar']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-survivor/josef-lewkowicz/michael-calvin/9781787636293,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7876/9781787636293.jpg

Why Politics Fails: The Five Traps of the Modern World & How to Escape Them (Hardback),Ben Ansell,"Why do the revolving doors of power always leave us disappointed? In Why Politics Fails, award-winning Oxford professor Ben Ansell shows that it's not the politicians that are the problem, it's that our collective goals result in five political 'traps'.Democracy: we all want a say in how we're governed, but it's impossible to have any true 'will of the people'. Equality: we want to be treated equally, but equal rights and equal outcomes undermine each other. Solidarity: we want a safety net when times are tough, but often we care about solidarity only when we need it ourselves. Security: we want protecting from harm, but not if it undermines our freedoms. Prosperity: we want to be richer tomorrow, but what makes us richer in the short run makes us poorer over the long haul.You've probably noticed a pattern here, which is that our self-interest undermines our ability to deliver on our collective goals. And these traps reinforce one another, so a polarized democracy can worsen inequality; a threadbare social safety net can worsen crime; runaway climate change will threaten global peace.Drawing on examples from Ancient Greece through Brexit and using his own counterintuitive and pathbreaking research - on why democracy thrives under high inequality, and how increased political and social equality can lead to greater class inequality - Ansell vividly illustrates how we can escape the political traps of our imperfect world. He shows that politics won't end, but that it doesn't have to fail.",2023-03-30,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', 'politicalscience', 'theory', '', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'religion', 'religion:general', 'religiousissues', 'debates', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'socialdiscrimination', 'inequality']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/why-politics-fails/ben-ansell/9780241517628,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2415/9780241517628.jpg

My Russia: War or Peace? (Hardback),Mikhail Shishkin,"In his timely new book, Mikhail Shishkin, argues that Russia is not a 'riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma': we just don't know enough about it. So what is the real story behind Putin's autocratic regime and its invasion of Ukraine? In My Russia: War or Peace? Shishkin traces the roots of Russia's problems, from the 'Kievan Rus' via the Grand Duchy of Moscow, empire, revolution and Cold War, to the now thirty-year-old Russian Federation. He explores the uneasy relationship between state and citizens, explains Russian attitudes to people's rights and democracy, and proposes that there are really two Russian peoples: the disillusioned and disaffected, who suffer from 'slave mentality', and those who embrace 'European' values and try to stand up to oppression. Both deeply personal and taking a broader historical view, My Russia is a passionate, eye-opening account of a state entangled in a complex and bloody past, as well as a love letter to a conflicted country.

To Battersea Park (Hardback),Philip Hensher,"An order is issued. A population may not meet, or touch or speak to each other. They stay inside, and the reality of a few streets in a capital city emerges. An underground river is discovered; an urban grove of pomeloes emerges. The imagination reaches out, and makes sense of the world. By the sea, two men walk into a future of uncertain violence. There is time now to see the human dramas within a hundred yards (an abduction, a quiet breakdown, an outbreak of violence, a young mind beginning to stretch itself); to wait for the weather to change; to understand that what lies underneath this part of the city are seasonally wet pastures and woodlands. Written in four parts, To Battersea Park explores the strata and sediment of a single place and time. It shows what brings us together, through love, through the clashes of what we want to do and what the world wants to do with us. Set in a large crowded city where we are forbidden to approach strangers, this is about what we share: humanity, imagination, and the love that emerges from many acts of telling.",2023-03-30,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', 'politicalcontrol', 'freedoms']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/to-battersea-park/philip-hensher/9780008323110,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0083/9780008323110.jpg

The Tour: The Story of the England Cricket Team Overseas 1877-2022 (Hardback),Simon Wilde,"An England cricket tour is a unique phenomenon, with its own pressures, challenges and remarkable highlights. It presents its participants - shorn of the usual support networks they enjoy at home - with a prolonged test of skill, physical stamina and mental resilience. Now Simon Wilde, author of the acclaimed England: The Biography, examines in The Tour the delicate chemistry that makes for a successful tour and why others disintegrate so badly. Since the 19th century, England has been sending its cricket teams around the world to take on their rivals. Initially, these trips were undertaken by boat, meaning players could be away for many months, often in alien conditions. With air travel reducing journey time and facilities much improved, the challenges still remain: homesickness, isolation, hostile crowds - not to mention an opposition determined to win at all costs. For some, the experience can be too much, while others thrive in the heat and dust of battle. The Tour looks at all aspects of the history of England's cricketers abroad, including the burden placed on the captain, who is expected to combine on-field acumen with the deft touch of an ambassador off it. There have been diplomatic incidents aplenty, from Douglas Jardine's Bodyline tactics to Len Hutton's tour of the Caribbean, as well as the special pressures of playing in countries such as India and Pakistan during periods of unrest. Touring has never lost its romance. There have been serious scrapes, from court cases to car crashes, but also much fun, whether joining in with the Barmy Army or David Gower famously taking a Tiger Moth for a spin. Wilde explains how this seemingly anachronistic activity has been adapted from an instrument of imperial soft power to a relentless cricket circus that never ends. Simon Wilde has once again created a masterpiece of insight, information and entertainment, an aspect of cricketing life that few will ever forget: the tour.",2023-03-30,"['sportsbooks', 'cricket']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-tour/simon-wilde/9781471198489,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4711/9781471198489.jpg

And in the songs to be sung, there is another hero: Sigurd, a warrior with a sword sharper than the new moon. As the legends tell, these names are destined to be lovers, fated as enemies. But here on Midgard, legends can be lies... For not all heroes are heroic, nor all monsters monstrous.

"Humanly Possible: Seven Hundred Years of Humanist Freethinking, Enquiry and Hope (Hardback)",Sarah Bakewell,"The bestselling, prizewinning author of How to Live and At the Existentialist Cafe explores 700 years of writers, thinkers, scientists and artists, all trying to understand what it means to be truly human. If you are reading this, it's likely you already have some affinity with humanism, even if you don't think of yourself in those terms. You may be drawn to literature and the humanities. You may prefer to base your moral choices on fellow-feeling and responsibility to others rather than on religious commandments. Or you may simply believe that individual lives are more important than grand political visions or dogmas. If any of these apply, you are part of a long tradition of humanist thought, and you share that tradition with many extraordinary individuals through history who have put rational enquiry, cultural richness, freedom of thought and a sense of hope at the heart of their lives. Humanly Possible introduces us to some of these people, as it asks what humanism is and why it has flourished for so long, despite opposition from fanatics, mystics and tyrants. It is a book brimming with ideas, personalities and experiments in living - from Erasmus to Esperanto, from anatomists to agnostics, from Christine de Pizan to Bertrand Russell to Zora Neale Hurston. It joyfully celebrates open-mindedness, optimism, freedom and the power of the here and now - humanist values which have helped steer us through dark times in the past, and which are just as urgently needed in our world today.",2023-03-30,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'culturalstudies', 'historyofideas', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'generalbiography', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/humanly-possible/sarah-bakewell/9781784741662,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7847/9781784741662.jpg

The Battle of Maldon: Together with the Homecoming of Beorhtnoth (Hardback),J. R. R. Tolkien,"First ever standalone edition of one of J.R.R. Tolkien's most important poetic dramas, that explores timely themes such as the nature of heroism and chivalry during war, and which features unpublished and never-before-seen texts and drafts. In 991 AD, vikings attacked an Anglo-Saxon defence-force led by their duke, Beorhtnoth, resulting in brutal fighting along the banks of the river Blackwater, near Maldon in Essex. The attack is widely considered one of the defining conflicts of tenth-century England, due to it being immortalised in the poem, The Battle of Maldon. Written shortly after the battle, the poem now survives only as a 325-line fragment, but its value to today is incalculable, not just as an heroic tale but in vividly expressing the lost language of our ancestors and celebrating ideals of loyalty and friendship. J.R.R. Tolkien considered The Battle of Maldon 'the last surviving fragment of ancient English heroic minstrelsy'. It would inspire him to compose, during the 1930s, his own dramatic verse-dialogue, The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son, which imagines the aftermath of the great battle when two of Beorhtnoth's retainers come to retrieve their duke's body. Leading Tolkien scholar, Peter Grybauskas, presents for the very first time J.R.R. Tolkien's own prose translation of The Battle of Maldon together with the definitive treatment of The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth and its accompanying essays; also included and never before published is Tolkien's bravura lecture, 'The Tradition of Versification in Old English', a wide-ranging essay on the nature of poetic tradition. Illuminated with insightful notes and commentary, he has produced a definitive critical edition of these works, and argues compellingly that, Beowulf excepted, The Battle of Maldon may well have been 'the Old English poem that most influenced Tolkien's fiction', most dramatically within the pages of The Lord of the Rings.",2023-03-30,"['sciencefiction', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'fantasy', '', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'poetry', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'poetry', 'individualpoets']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-battle-of-maldon/j-r-r-tolkien/peter-grybauskas/9780008465827,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0084/9780008465827.jpg

Great and Horrible News: Murder and Mayhem in Early Modern Britain (Hardback),Blessin Adams,"Nine historic crimes. One familiar obsession. In early modern England, murder truly was most foul. Trials were gossipy events packed to the rafters with noisome spectators. Executions were public proceedings which promised not only gore, but desperate confessions and the grandest, most righteous human drama. Bookshops saw grisly stories of crime and death sell like hot cakes. This history unfolds the true stories of murder, criminal investigation, early forensic techniques, high court trials and so much more. In thrilling narrative, we follow a fugitive killer through the streets of London, citizen detectives clamouring to help officials close the net. We untangle the mystery of a suspected staged suicide through the newly emerging science of forensic pathology. We see a mother trying to clear her dead daughter's name while other women faced the accusations - sometimes true and sometimes not - of murdering their own children. These stories are pieced together from original research using coroner's inquests, court records, parish archives, letters, diaries and the cheap street pamphlets that proliferated to satisfy a voracious public. These intensely personal stories portray the lives of real people as they confronted the extraordinary crises of murder, infanticide, miscarriage and suicide. Many historical laws and attitudes concerning death and murder may strike us as exceptionally cruel, and yet many still remind us that some things never change: we are still fascinated by narratives of murder and true crime, murder trials today continue to be grand public spectacles, female killers are frequently cast as aberrant objects of public hatred and sexual desire, and suicide remains a sin within many religious organisations and was a crime in England until the 1960s. Great and Horrible News! explores the strange history of death and murder in early modern England, yet the stories within may appear shockingly familiar.",2023-03-30,"['crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'truecrime', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'truestories', 'truestoriesofheroism', 'endurance', 'survival', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'europe']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/great-and-horrible-news/blessin-adams/9780008500221,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0085/9780008500221.jpg

"Reach for the Stars: 1996-2006: Fame, Fallout and Pop's Final Party (Hardback)",Michael Cragg,"'You'll love it.' - RICHARD OSMAN  'Nobody buys books. No one's going to read this.' - LOUIS WALSH  Using the arrival of the Spice Girls as a jumping-off point, this fascinating new narrative will explore, celebrate and contextualise the thus-far-uncharted period of British pop that flourished between 1996 and 2006. A double-denim-loving time before the glare of social media and the accession of streaming.  The bastions of '00s pop - armed with buoyant, immaculately crafted, carefree anthems - provided entertainment, escapism and fun for millions. It was a heady, chorus-heavy decade - populated by the likes of Steps, S Club 7, Blue, 5ive, Mis-Teeq, Hear'Say, Busted, Girls Aloud, McFly, Craig David and Atomic Kitten, among countless others - yet the music was often dismissed as inauthentic, juvenile, not 'worthy' enough: ultimately, a 'guilty pleasure'.   Now, music writer Michael Cragg aims to redress that balance. Using the oral-history format, Cragg goes beneath the surface of the bubblegum exterior, speaking to hundred's of the key players about the reality of their experiences.    Compiled from interviews with popstars, songwriters, producers, choreographers, magazine editors, record-company executives, TV moguls and more, this is a complete behind-the-scenes history of the last great movement in British pop - a technicolour turning-point ripe for re-evaluation, documented here in astonishing, honest and eye-opening detail.",2023-03-30,"['entertainment', 'music', 'musicreviews', 'criticism', '', 'entertainment', 'music', 'musicalstyles', 'genres', 'entertainment', 'music', 'musicalstyles', 'genres', 'rock', 'pop']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/reach-for-the-stars/michael-cragg/9781788707244,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7887/9781788707244.jpg

Shakespeare's Book: The Intertwined Lives Behind the First Folio (Hardback),Chris Laoutaris,"The year 2023 marks the 400th anniversary of Mr William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies, known today simply as the First Folio. It is difficult to imagine a world without The Tempest, Twelfth Night, Antony and Cleopatra, The Winter's Tale and Macbeth, but these are just some of the plays that were only preserved thanks to the astounding labour of love that went into creating the first collection. Shakespeare's Book: The Intertwined Lives Behind the First Folio charts, for the first time, the manufacture of the First Folio against a turbulent backdrop of seismic political events and international tensions that intersected with the lives of its creators. Shakespeare scholar Dr Chris Laoutaris uncovers the friendships, bonds, social ties and professional networks that facilitated the production of Shakespeare ' s book, as well as the personal challenges, tragedies and dangers that threatened its completion. And he considers how Shakespeare himself, before his death, may have influenced the ways in which his own public identity would come to be enshrined in the First Folio, shaping the transmission of his legacy to future generations and determining how the world would remember him 'not of an age, but for all time'.",2023-03-30,"['poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'literature:history', 'criticism', 'poetry', 'poets', '', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'literature:history', 'criticism', 'plays', 'playwrights', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'literature:history', 'criticism', 'plays', 'playwrights', 'shakespearestudies', 'criticism']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/shakespeares-book/chris-laoutaris/9780008238384,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0082/9780008238384.jpg

The Long View: Why We Need to Transform How the World Sees Time (Hardback),Richard Fisher,"'A beautifully turned, calmly persuasive but urgent book' IAN MCEWAN 'A landmark book that could help to build a much brighter future' DAVID ROBSON A wide-ranging and thought-provoking exploration of the importance of long-term thinking.Humans are unique in our ability to understand time, able to comprehend the past and future like no other species. Yet modern-day technology and capitalism have supercharged our short-termist tendencies and trapped us in the present, at the mercy of reactive politics, quarterly business targets and 24-hour news cycles.It wasn't always so. In medieval times, craftsmen worked on cathedrals that would be unfinished in their lifetime. Indigenous leaders fostered intergenerational reciprocity. And in the early twentieth century, writers  dreamed of worlds thousands of years hence. Now, as we face long-term challenges on an unprecedented scale, how do we recapture that far-sighted vision?Richard Fisher takes us from the boardrooms of Japan - home to some of the world's oldest businesses - to an Australian laboratory where an experiment started a century ago is still going strong. He examines the psychological biases that discourage the long view, and talks to the growing number of people from the worlds of philosophy, technology, science and the arts who are exploring smart ways to overcome them. How can we learn to widen our perception of time and honour our obligations to the lives of those not yet born?Praise for The Long View:'A wise, humane book laced with curiosity and hope. It will open your mind and horizons - and leave you giddy at the prospect of all that we may yet become.' Tom Chatfield, author of How to Think 'Hope-filled and revelatory ...

Like pilots, roofers and mountain climbers, mariners are obsessed with the weather, immersed in it as part of their daily calculus . . . Make good decisions, mariners are fond of saying.

Staying the Distance: The lessons from sport that business leaders have been missing (Hardback),Catherine Baker,"Staying the Distance showcases the much-needed leadership lessons that sport can teach us: how to improve, perform and achieve, in ways that are effective and sustainable. Leadership can be hard. It can certainly be relentless.

Operation Chiffon: The Secret Story of MI5 and MI6 and the Road to Peace in Ireland (Hardback),Peter Taylor,"On the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, Peter Taylor tells for the first time the gripping story of Operation Chiffon, MI5's top-secret intelligence operation that helped bring peace to Ireland. April 1998: the Good Friday Agreement is signed, ending decades of violence and bloodshed in Northern Ireland. The process of getting the IRA to end its so-called 'armed struggle' was always the prerequisite of the search for peace. It was Operation Chiffon that finally helped make it possible. Operation Chiffon takes us inside the top-secret intelligence operation whose roots go back to the bloodiest years of the conflict in the early 1970s, involving officers from MI6 and, later in the 1990s, MI5. The remarkable story, which has remained hidden for forty years, is now revealed by legendary BBC journalist Peter Taylor with unique access to the officers involved. Drawing on exclusive interviews and Taylor's fifty years of covering the conflict, the book narrates in first-hand detail how those involved risked their careers - and their lives - to help secure the fragile peace that exists today. Taylor vividly brings this covert operation to life and in the process chronicles the history of Sinn Fein, rising from obscurity in the early days of the Troubles to becoming the largest political party in Ireland today. It is a story fraught with uncertainty and danger that, as Brexit risks destabilising what was achieved in the Good Friday Agreement twenty-five years ago, is more important than ever to remember.",2023-03-30,"['history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'britain', 'ireland']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/operation-chiffon/peter-taylor/9781526659637,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5266/9781526659637.jpg

Hushed whispers, secret rendezvous and bloody betrayals. Everyone has their dirty laundry, but this goes beyond gossip. This is all-out war. A deliciously scandalous page-turner about the dark side of suburbia that peels back the layers of Ciara's insta-perfect life to reveal friendships gone rotten, manipulation masquerading as love and families riddled with lies.",2023-03-30,"['crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'thrillers']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/dirty-laundry/disha-bose/9780241556153,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2415/9780241556153.jpg

"All the Wide Border: Wales, England and the Places Between (Hardback)",Mike Parker,"A funny, warm and timely meditation on identity and belonging, following the scenic route along the England-Wales border: Britain's deepest faultline. There is a line on the map: to one side Wales, small, rugged and stubborn; the other England, crucible of the most expansionist culture the world has ever seen. It is a line that has been dug, debated, defined and defended for twenty centuries. All the Wide Border is a personal journey through the places, amongst the people, and across the divides of the border between England and Wales. Taking in some of our loveliest landscapes, and our darkest secrets, this is a region of immeasurable wonder and interest. It is there that the deepest roots and thorniest paradoxes of Britishness lie. The border between the countries, even as a concept, is ragged, jagged and many-layered. Garlanded author Mike Parker has adored and explored these places his entire life. Born in England but settled in Wales, he finds himself typical of many in being pulled in both directions. His journey is divided into three legs, corresponding with the watersheds of the three great border rivers: the Dee in the north, the Severn in the centre, the Wye in the south. Neither quite England nor Wales, the furzy borderland he uncovers - the March - is another country. A hefty schlep from everywhere, these are A. E. Housman's 'blue remembered hills' - his 'land of lost content' - and ours too. Picking apart the many notions and cliches of Englishness, Welshness and indeed Britishness, Mike Parker plays with the very idea of borders, our fascination with them, our need for them, and our response to their power. In his hands, England-Wales border is revealed to be a border within us all, and it is fraying, fast.",2023-03-30,"['history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', '', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'otherlands', 'travel', 'maps', 'travelwriting', 'classictravelwriting']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/all-the-wide-border/mike-parker/9780008499181,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0084/9780008499181.jpg

Immortal Thoughts: Late Style in a Time of Plague (Hardback),Christopher  Neve,"A remarkable, heartfelt, beautifully written analysis of the late work of 19 major artists that Max Porter describes as 'completely and utterly marvellous'.   'Painting ... exists and exults in immortal thoughts' William Blake In 2020, as the spread of Covid-19 causes pandemonium worldwide, an elderly artist returns to his childhood home to watch the transcendent beauty of the seasons and reflect on the final work of the artists he most admires. It seems to him that in their final art works - their late style - that they have something remarkable in common. This has more to do with intuition and memory than with rationality or reason and comes from trying to write about painting itself.  Immortal Thoughts: Late Style in a Time of Plague is an anthology of these reflections. In this personal and moving account, nineteen short essays on artists are interspersed with short accounts of the cataclysmic global progress of the disease in poignant contrast to the beauty of the seasons in the isolated house and garden, narrative strands that are closely intertwined. From Cezanne's last watercolours to Michelangelo's final five drawings, Rembrandt and suffering to Gwen John and absence, Christopher Neve dwells on artists' late ideas, memory, risk, handling and places, in the terrible context of Time and mortality.  As much art history as a discussion of great art in the context of the Dance of Death, Neve writes with renewed passion about Bonnard, Michelangelo, Morandi, Poussin, Soutine and many others in his distinctive style.",2023-03-30,"['art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'art', 'designstyles/historyofart']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/immortal-thoughts/christopher-neve/9780500025796,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/5000/9780500025796.jpg
Under the Henfluence: The World of Chickens and the People Who Love Them (Hardback),Tove Danovich,"An immersive blend of chicken-keeping memoir and animal welfare reporting by a journalist who accidentally became obsessed with her flock. Since first domesticating the chicken thousands of years ago, humans have become exceptionally adept at raising them for food. Yet most people rarely interact with chickens or know much about them. In Under the Henfluence, Tove Danovich explores the lives of these quirky, mysterious birds who stole her heart the moment her first box of chicks arrived at the post office. From a hatchery in Iowa to a chicken show in Ohio to a rooster rescue in Minnesota, Danovich interviews the people breeding, training, healing and, most importantly, adoring chickens. With more than 60 billion chickens living on industrial farms around the world, they're easy to dismiss as just another dinner ingredient. Yet Danovich's reporting reveals the hidden cleverness, quiet sweetness and irresistible personalities of these birds, as well as the complex human-chicken relationship that has evolved over centuries. This glimpse into the lives of backyard chickens doesn't just help us to understand chickens better - it also casts light back on ourselves and what we've ignored throughout the explosive growth of industrial agriculture. Woven with delightful and sometimes heartbreaking anecdotes from Danovich's own henhouse, Under the Henfluence proves that chickens are so much more than what they bring to the table.",2023-03-30,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', 'farm', 'workinganimals', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'animals', 'society', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'mathematics', 'science', 'biology/lifesciences', 'evolution']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/under-the-henfluence/tove-danovich/9780008505868,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0085/9780008505868.jpg

The Marriage Question: George Eliot's Double Life (Hardback),Clare Carlisle,"When she was in her mid-thirties, Marian Evans transformed herself into George Eliot - an author celebrated for her genius as soon as she published her debut novel. During those years she also found her life partner, George Lewes - writer, philosopher and married father of three. After 'eloping' to Berlin in 1854 they lived together for twenty-four years: Eliot asked people to call her 'Mrs Lewes' and dedicated each novel to her 'Husband'. Though they could not legally marry, she felt herself initiated into the 'great experience' of marriage - 'this double life, which helps me to feel and think with double strength'. The relationship scandalized her contemporaries yet she grew immeasurably within it. Living at once inside and outside marriage, Eliot could experience this form of life - so familiar yet also so perplexing - from both sides. In The Marriage Question Clare Carlisle reveals Eliot to be not only a great artist but a brilliant philosopher who probes the tensions and complexities of a shared life. Through the immense ambition and dark marriage plots of her novels we see Eliot wrestling - in art and in life - with themes of desire and sacrifice, motherhood and creativity, trust and disillusion, destiny and chance. Reading them afresh, Carlisle's searching new biography explores how marriage questions grow and change, and joins Eliot in her struggle to marry thought and feeling.",2023-03-23,"['biography', 'truestories', 'literarybiographies']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-marriage-question/clare-carlisle/9780241447178,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2414/9780241447178.jpg

The food system is no longer simply a means of sustenance. It is one of the most successful, most innovative and most destructive industries on earth. It sustains us, but it is also killing us. Diet-related disease is now the biggest cause of preventable illness and death in the developed world - far worse than smoking. The environmental damage done by the food system is also changing climate patterns and degrading the earth, risking our food security. Few people know the workings of the food system better than Henry Dimbleby, founder of the Leon restaurant chain, government adviser and author of the radical National Food Strategy. In Ravenous, he takes us behind the scenes to reveal the mechanisms that act together to shape the modern diet - and therefore the world.

"Poverty, by America (Hardback)",Matthew Desmond,"A searing study of American poverty from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Evicted. The United States is the richest country on earth, yet has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. One in seven Americans live below the poverty line, a line which hasn't shifted over the last fifty years, despite the efforts of successive governments and extensive relief programs. Why is there so much scarcity in this land of dollars? In Poverty, by America, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond examines the nature of American poverty today and the stories we tell ourselves about it. Spanning racism, social isolation, mass incarceration, the housing crisis, domestic violence, crack and opioid epidemics, welfare cuts and more, Desmond argues that poverty does not result from a lack of resources or good policy ideas. We already know how to eliminate it. The hard part is getting more of us to care. To do so, we need a new story. As things stand, liberals explain poverty through insurmountable structural issues, whereas conservatives highlight personal failings and poor life choices. Both analyses abdicate responsibility, and ignore the reality that the advantages of the rich only come at the expense of the poor. It is time better-paid citizens put themselves back in the narrative, recognizing that the depth and expanse of poverty in any nation reflects our failure to look out for one another. Poverty must ultimately be met by community: all this suffering and want is our doing, and we can undo it.",2023-03-21,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'poverty', 'unemployment', '', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'prose:non-fiction', 'reportage', 'collectedjournalism', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'housing', 'homelessness']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/poverty-by-america/matthew-desmond/9780241543221,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2415/9780241543221.jpg

Devoted siblings, they're bound together in their childhood home by the tragic death of their parents.

"Courting India: England, Mughal India and the Origins of Empire (Hardback)",Nandini Das,"When Thomas Roe arrived in India in 1616 as James I's first ambassador to the Mughal Empire, the English barely had a toehold in the subcontinent. Their understanding of South Asian trade and India was sketchy at best, and, to the Mughals, they were minor players on a very large stage. Roe was representing a kingdom that was beset by financial woes and deeply conflicted about its identity as a unified 'Great Britain' under the Stuart monarchy. Meanwhile, the court he entered in India was wealthy and cultured, its dominion widely considered to be one of the greatest and richest empires of the world... In Nandini Das's fascinating history of Roe's four years in India, she offers an insider's view of a Britain in the making, a country whose imperial seeds were just being sown. It is a story of palace intrigue and scandal, lotteries and wagers that unfolds as global trade begins to stretch from Russia to Virginia, from West Africa to the Spice Islands of Indonesia. A major debut that explores the art, literature, sights and sounds of Jacobean London and Imperial India, Courting India reveals Thomas Roe's time in the Mughal Empire to be a turning point in history - and offers a rich and radical challenge to our understanding of Britain and its early empire.",2023-03-16,"['history', 'general', 'worldhistory', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', 'internationalrelations', 'diplomacy']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/courting-india/nandini-das/9781526615640,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5266/9781526615640.jpg

A Terribly Serious Adventure: Philosophy at Oxford 1900-60 (Hardback),Nikhil Krishnan,"What are the limits of language? How to bring philosophy closer to everyday life? What is a good human being?  These were among the questions that philosophers wrestled with in mid-twentieth-century Britain, a period shadowed by war and the rise of fascism. In response to these events, thinkers such as Gilbert Ryle, J. L. Austin, Elizabeth Anscombe and Iris Murdoch aspired to a new level of watchfulness and self-awareness about language. Being vigilant about their words was their way to keep philosophy true to everyday experience.   A Terribly Serious Adventure traces the friendships and the rivalries, the shared preoccupations and the passionate disagreements of Oxford's most brilliant thinkers. Far from being stuck in a world of tweed, pipes and public schools, the Oxford philosophers drew on their wartime lives as soldiers and spies, conscientious objectors and prisoners of war in creating their greatest works, works that are original in both thought and style, true masterpieces of British modernism.   Nikhil Krishnan brings his knowledge and understanding of philosophy to bear on the lives and intellectual achievements of a large and lively cast of characters. Together, they stood for a compelling moral vision of philosophy that is still with us today.",2023-03-16,"['history', 'historicalperiods', '20thcenturyhistory:1900to2000', '', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'philosophy']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/a-terribly-serious-adventure/nikhil-krishnan/9781800812369,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8008/9781800812369.jpg

The company's formulas have been respected for nearly a century, but have always remained cloaked in mystery.

Surrealists in New York: Atelier 17 and the Birth of Abstract Expressionism (Hardback),Charles Darwent,"An absorbing group biography revealing how exiles from war-torn France brought Surrealism to America, helping to shift the centre of the art world from Paris to New York and spark the movement that became Abstract Expressionism.  In 1957 the American artist Robert Motherwell made an unexpected claim: 'I have only known two painting milieus well ... the Parisian Surrealists, with whom I began painting seriously in New York in 1940, and the native movement that has come to be known as ""abstract expressionism"", but which genetically would have been more properly called ""abstract surrealism"".'  Motherwell's bold assertion, that Abstract Expressionism was neither new nor local, but born of a brief liaison between America and France, verged on the controversial. Surrealists in New York tells the story of this 'liaison' and the European exiles who bought Surrealism with them - an artistic exchange between the Old World and the New - centring on taciturn printmaker Stanley William Hayter and the legendary Atelier 17 print studio he founded. Here artists' experiments literally pushed the boundaries of modern art. It was in Hayter's studio that Jackson Pollock found the balance of freedom and control that would culminate in his distinctive drip paintings.  The impact of Max Ernst, Andre Masson, Louise Bourgeois and other noted emigres on the work of Motherwell, Pollock, Mark Rothko and the American avant-garde has for too long been quietly written out of art history. Drawing on first-hand documents, interviews and archive materials, Charles Darwent brings to life the events and personalities from this crucial encounter. In so doing, he reveals a fascinating new perspective on the history of the art of the twentieth century.",2023-03-16,"['art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'art', 'designstyles/historyofart', 'abstractexpressionism']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/surrealists-in-new-york/charles-darwent/9780500094266,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/5000/9780500094266.jpg

Great Kingdoms of Africa (Hardback),John Parker,"An essential overview of great kingdoms in African history and their legacies, written by world-leading experts.  From the ancient Nile Valley to the savannas of medieval West Africa, the highlands of Ethiopia and on to the forests, lakes and grasslands to the south, African civilizations have given rise to some of the world's most impressive kingdoms. Yet Africa's history is often little known beyond the devastation wrought by the slave trade and European colonial rule. In this groundbreaking new book, nine leading historians of Africa take a fresh look at these great kingdoms and empires over five thousand years of recorded history.  How was kingship forged in Africa and how did it operate? Was dynastic power maintained by consent or by coercion? Did kings - and queens - display and project that power for all to see, or did they hide it away, as beneath the fringed crowns that concealed the faces of sacred Yoruba rulers? In what ways have African peoples themselves recorded, celebrated and critiqued the deeds of their kings? Great Kingdoms of Africa explores some of the most important questions in the continent's deep past.  As elsewhere in the world, absolute monarchy in Africa has been on the wane in the modern era. Yet kingship continues to thrive within many present-day African nations, preserving deep-rooted ideas about culture, identity and sacred power. Presenting exciting developments in the understanding of how states and societies have interacted with each other across time, this book shows how powerful and sophisticated kingdoms have shaped the course of African history - and continue to do so in the present day.",2023-03-16,"['history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'africa']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/great-kingdoms-of-africa/john-parker/david-adjaye/9780500252529,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/5002/9780500252529.jpg
Glowing Still: A Woman's Life on the Road (Hardback),Sara Wheeler,"Sara Wheeler is Britain's foremost woman travel writer. Glowing Still is the story of her travelling life - what is 'important, revealing or funny' - in a notoriously testosterone-laden field. Growing up among blue-collar Conservatives in Bristol where 'we didn't know anyone who wasn't like us', Wheeler knew she needed to get away. In her twenties she began a dramatic escape: Pole to Pole, via Poland. Glowing Still recalls happy days on India's Puri Express; an Antarctic lavatory through which a seal popped up (hot fishy breath!); and the louche life of a Parisian shopgirl. Corralling reindeer with the Sami in Arctic Sweden and towing her baby on a sledge, a helpful herdsman advised her to put foil down her bra to facilitate nursing. Launching at Nubility, Wheeler voyages, via small children, to the welcoming port of Invisibility (she leaves Immobility for the next volume). As she writes in the introduction, when she set sail 'Role models were scarce in the travel-writing game.' But advancing years usher in unheralded freedoms, and journey's end finds Wheeler at peace among Zanzibar dhows, contemplating our connection with other lives - the irreplaceable value that travel brings - and paying homage to her heroines, among them Martha Gellhorn, the ineffable war correspondent who furnishes Wheeler's epigraph:  'I do not wish to be good.

The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden's White House (Hardback),Chris Whipple,"In January of 2021, the Biden administration inherited the most daunting array of challenges since FDR's presidency: a lethal pandemic, a plummeting economy, an unresolved twenty-year war, and the aftermath of an attack on the Capitol that polarized the country. Waves of crises followed, including the fallout from a divisive Supreme Court, raging inflation, and Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Now, in The Fight of His Life, prizewinning journalist Chris Whipple takes us inside the Oval Office as the critical decisions of Biden's presidency are being made. With remarkable access to both President Biden and his inner circle-including Chief of Staff Ron Klain, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and CIA Director William Burns-Whipple pulls back the curtain on the internal power struggles and back-room compromises. Featuring shocking new details about how renegade Trump officials enabled the transfer of power, which key staffers really make the White House run (it's probably not who you think), why Joe Biden no longer speaks freely around his security detail, and what he really thinks of Vice President Kamala Harris, the press, and living in the White House, The Fight of His Life delivers a stunning portrait of politics on the edge.",2023-03-16,"['biography', 'truestories', 'historical', 'political', 'militarybiographies', 'historical', 'political', 'militaryautobiographies']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-fight-of-his-life/chris-whipple/9781982106430,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/9821/9781982106430.jpg
Spoken Word: The Story of How Performance Poetry Changed the World (Hardback),Dr. Joshua Bennett,"In 2009, at only twenty years old, Joshua Bennett was invited to recite a poem for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House's Evening of Poetry, Music, and the Spoken Word. Spike Lee and Saul Williams were in the audience, and it turned out to be the very same event where Lin-Manuel Miranda first performed a work-in-progress that revolutionised musical theatre - Hamilton. Blending memoir and literary analysis, Bennett shows how a handful of visionaries altered modern culture. With passion, wit and erudition, he charts the history of spoken-word poetry, as well as his coming-of-age journey as a writer. From the early influence of Miguel Algarin and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe to Amanda Gorman's inauguration poem for President Joe Biden, he celebrates the contributions of legendary figures such as Ntozake Shange, Nikki Giovanni and Miguel Pinero, as well as how artists like MF DOOM, Jill Scott and Mos Def were inspired to develop their craft within their shared tradition. Spoken Word illuminates the profound influence that poetry has had everywhere melodious words are heard, from the West End to academia, from the podiums of political protest to cafes, from schools to rooms full of strangers all across the world.",2023-03-16,"['history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', '', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'poetry', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'oralhistory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/spoken-word/dr-joshua-bennett/9781529110487,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5291/9781529110487.jpg
The History of the Hobbit: One Volume Edition (Hardback),J. R. R. Tolkien,"The Hobbit was first published on 21 September 1937. Like its sequel, The Lord of the Rings, it is a story that 'grew in the telling', and many characters and plot threads in the published text are quite different from the story J.R.R. Tolkien first wrote to read aloud to his young sons as one of their 'fireside reads'. Together in one volume, The History of the Hobbit presents the complete text of the unpublished manuscript of The Hobbit, accompanied by John Rateliff's lively and informative account of how the book came to be written and published. Recording the numerous changes made to the story both before and after publication, he examines - chapter by chapter - why those changes were made and how they reflect Tolkien's ever-growing concept of Middle-earth. As well as reproducing the original version of one of the world's most popular novels - both on its own merits and as the foundation for The Lord of the Rings - this book includes many little-known illustrations and draft maps for The Hobbit by Tolkien himself. Also featured are extensive commentaries on the dates of composition, how Tolkien's professional and early mythological writings influenced the story, the imaginary geography he created, and how Tolkien came to revise the book years after publication to accommodate events in The Lord of the Rings. Endorsed by Christopher Tolkien as a companion to his essential 12-volume The History of Middle-earth, this thoughtful and exhaustive examination of one of the most treasured stories in English literature offers fascinating new insights for those who have grown up with this enchanting tale, and will delight any who are about to enter Bilbo's round door for the first time.",2023-03-16,"['poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'literature:history', 'criticism', 'fiction', 'novelists', 'prosewriters', '', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'literature:history', 'criticism', 'literaryreferenceworks', 'fiction', 'classicfiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-history-of-the-hobbit/j-r-r-tolkien/john-d-rateliff/9780008601409,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0086/9780008601409.jpg
Alistair Cooke's America: 50th Anniversary Edition (Paperback),Alistair Cooke,"For more than sixty years Alistair Cooke wrote and broadcast on every facet of American life with incomparable wit and wisdom. This is his 'personal history' of America, the best-selling book that accompanied his legendary BBC television series which was first broadcast in November 1972. It has sold over two million copies and has emerged through tumultuous times to become regarded as a classic. It is an irresistibly readable guide to what has made this powerful democracy work and survive through 200 years.  Alistair writes with authority about the explorers who put their new-found land on the map, the pioneers who tamed the Wild West, the soldiers who fought for independence, the slaves who fled north, the tycoons who built fortunes and the immigrants that sought a new life. From the Mayflower to the gold rush, the jazz age to Pearl Harbor, with portraits of figures as varied as Buffalo Bill, John D. Rockefeller and Martin Luther King Jr., here is the American story in all its triumphs and failures, grandeurs and tragedies. It is the defining portrait of a nation.

Paris: The Memoir (Hardback),Paris Hilton,"Behind Paris Hilton's meteoric rise from Upper West Side club kid to household name lies her self-proclaimed 'superpower' of ADHD and a hidden history that traumatized and defined her. Shocking, funny and surprisingly profound, Paris is the deeply personal memoir of the ultimate It Girl and a stunning inside view of a pop culture phenomenon. Until, in a revealing documentary, she disclosed that her childhood was shattered by two years of strip searches, isolation, beatings, restraint, and brainwashing within the now infamous 'troubled teen industry', Paris Hilton was simply the billionaire heiress America had watched grow up on television, on the internet, and in tabloids. But there was always more to Paris Hilton than met the eye. Yes, she is the media personality, DJ, entrepreneur, model, singer, actress and icon beloved all over the globe. And yet... Paris is the story people have always wanted Paris Hilton to tell - the story of who she really is. In this revealing and thought-provoking book, Paris will separate the creation from the creator, the brand from the ambassador, and show the woman who grew up with incredible privilege, but who was also trapped in a world of unreasonable expectation at a moment when young women were humiliated for sport in a gossip economy on steroids. Paris recounts her perilous journey through pre-#METOO sexual politics with grace, generosity, and plenty of fun, rising above a series of heart-wrenching challenges to find healing, lasting love and a life of meaning and purpose. The parallel story arcs in Paris' braided narrative come to full bloom as a watershed portrait of the Noughties, challenging each of us to question our role in her story and her role in ours. The result is an intimate and unexpected memoir about persona and personification, the price of being young and disobedient, and the complexity of manifesting your dreams after watching part of yourself disappear.",2023-03-14,"['biography', 'truestories', 'arts', 'entertainmentbiographies', 'arts', 'entertainmentautobiographies', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'arts', 'entertainmentbiographies', 'biography', 'truestories', 'truestories', 'truestoriesofheroism', 'endurance', 'survival']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/paris/paris-hilton/9780008524463,https://cdn.waterstones.com/override/v4/large/9780/0085/9780008524463.jpg
"Still Life with Bones: Genocide, Forensics, and What Remains (Hardback)",Dr Alexa Hagerty,"'Chilling and vital. . . sensitive and thought-provoking' The TimesAn anthropologist working with forensic teams and victims' families to investigate crimes against humanity in Latin America explores what science can tell us about the lives of the dead in this haunting account of grief, the power of ritual, and a quest for justice.""Exhumation can divide brothers and restore fathers, open old wounds and open the possibility of regeneration-of building something new with the pile of broken mirrors that is loss and mourning.""Over the course of Guatemala's thirty-year armed conflict -the longest ever in Central America-over 200,000 people were killed. During Argentina's military dictatorship in the seventies, over 30,000 people were disappeared. Today, forensic anthropologists in each country are gathering evidence to prove atrocities and seek justice. But these teams do more than just study skeletons-they work to repair families and countries torn apart by violence.In Still Life with Bones, anthropologist Alexa Hagerty learns to see the dead body with a forensic eye. She examines bones for evidence of torture and fatal wounds-hands bound by rope, cuts from machetes-but also for signs of a life lived: to articulate how life shapes us down to the bone. A weaver is recognized from the tiny bones of the toes, molded by years of kneeling before a loom; a girl is identified alongside her pet dog. In the tenderness of understanding these bones, Hagerty discovers how exhumation serves as a ritual in the naming and placement of the dead, and connects ancestors with future generations. She shows us how this work can bring meaning to families dealing with unimaginable loss, and how its symbolic force can also extend to entire societies in the aftermath of state terror and genocide. Encountering the dead has the power to transform us, making us consider each other, our lives, and the world differently.Weaving together powerful stories about investigative breakthroughs, grieving families, histories of violence, and her own forensic coming of age, Hagerty crafts a moving portrait of the living and the dead.""Touching, but achingly honest-a most amazing account of training as a forensic anthropologist. When Hagerty talks about ""lives being violently made into bones,"" I defy you not to be moved. The text is unflinching, but then the crimes and the victims deserve nothing less. I guarantee this will make you think long and hard about cruelty and human rights and the dedication and humanity of the forensic scientist."" - PROFESSOR DAME SUE BLACK",2023-03-14,"['biography', 'truestories', 'science', 'technology', 'medicinebiographies', 'science', 'technology', 'medicineautobiographies', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'biography', 'truestories', 'generalbiography']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/still-life-with-bones-genocide-forensics-and-what-remains/dr-alexa-hagerty/9781472295774,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4722/9781472295774.jpg
In Memoriam: THE TOP FIVE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER (Hardback),Alice Winn,"A gripping, heart-shattering love story between two soldiers in the First World War. It's 1914, and talk of war feels far away to Henry Gaunt, Sidney Ellwood and the rest of their classmates, safely ensconced in their idyllic boarding school in the English countryside. At seventeen, they're too young to enlist, and anyway, Gaunt is fighting his own private battle - an all-consuming infatuation with his best friend, the dreamy, poetic Ellwood - not having a clue that Ellwood is in love with him, always has been. When Gaunt's German mother asks him to enlist as an officer in the British army to protect the family from anti-German attacks, Gaunt signs up immediately, relieved to escape his overwhelming feelings for Ellwood. The front is horrific, of course, and though Gaunt tries to dissuade Ellwood from joining him on the battlefield, Ellwood soon rushes to join him, spurred on by his love of Greek heroes and romantic poetry. Before long, their classmates have followed suit. Once in the trenches, Ellwood and Gaunt find fleeting moments of solace in one another, but their friends are all dying, right in front of them, and at any moment they could be next. An epic tale of both the devastating tragedies of war and the forbidden romance that blooms in its grip, In Memoriam is a breathtaking debut.",2023-03-09,"['fiction', 'historicalfiction', '', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'war', 'combatfiction', 'firstworldwar', 'romanticfiction', 'historicalromance']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/in-memoriam/alice-winn/9780241567821,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2415/9780241567821.jpg
So Shall You Reap (Hardback),Donna Leon,"On a cold November evening, Guido Brunetti and Paola are up late when a call from his colleague Ispettore Vianello arrives, alerting the Commissario that a hand has been seen in one of Venice's canals. The body is soon found, and Brunetti is assigned to investigate the murder of an undocumented Sri Lankan immigrant. Because no official record of the man's presence in Venice exists, Brunetti is forced to use the city's far richer sources of information: gossip and the memories of people who knew the victim. Curiously, he had been living in a garden house on the grounds of a palazzo owned by a university professor, in which Brunetti discovers books revealing the victim's interest in Buddhism, the revolutionary Tamil Tigers, and the last crop of Italian political terrorists, active in the 1980s. As the investigation expands, Brunetti, Vianello, Commissario Griffoni, and Signorina Elettra each assemble pieces of a puzzle-random information about real estate and land use, books, university friendships-that appear to have little in common. Until Brunetti stumbles over something that transports him back to his own student days, causing him to reflect on lost ideals and the errors of youth, on Italian politics and history, and on the accidents that sometimes lead to revelation.",2023-03-09,"['crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'crime', 'mystery', '', 'fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'thrillers']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/so-shall-you-reap/donna-leon/9781529153316,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5291/9781529153316.jpg

And in the ten years since, she's lived by one rule: don't let them find you. Easier said than done, when her magic ties her to the city. Mortem is a magic born from death, and it's a high-priced and illicit commodity in Dellaire. Lore has made a living running poisons for the city's underbelly, but when a run goes wrong she's captured by the king and expects to be sent to the pyre. But the king has different plans. Lore is thrust into the Sainted King's glittering court, where no one can be believed and even fewer can be trusted.

Meanwhile, as the now-Duke of Windsor awaited the decree that would allow him to marry his mistress Wallis Simpson, he took an increasing interest in the expansionist plans of the Fuhrer of Germany. The Windsors at War tells the story of the turbulent and seismic decade in between 1937 and 1947, including the bombing of Buckingham Palace in May 1940, the Duke of Windsor's ill-advised visit to Germany in October 1937 and the death of the Duke of Kent in a plane crash in August 1942.

Our sense of enchantment is not only sparked by grand things. The awe-inspiring, the numinous, is all around us, all the time. It is transformed by our deliberate attention. The magic is of our own conjuring. Feeling bone-tired, anxious and overwhelmed by the rolling news cycle and the pandemic age, Katherine May seeks to unravel the threads of a life wound too tightly. Could there be another way to live - one that feels more meaningful, more grounded in the places beneath our feet? One that would allow us to feel more connected, more rested and at ease, even as seismic changes unfold on the planet?

The Collaborators: Three Stories of Deception and Survival in World War II (Hardback),Ian Buruma,"On the face of it, the three characters here seem to have little in common - aside from the fact that each committed wartime acts that led some to see them as national heroes, and others as villains. All three were mythmakers, larger-than-life storytellers, for whom the truth was beside the point. Felix Kersten was a plump Finnish pleasure-seeker who became Heinrich Himmler's indispensable personal masseur - Himmler calling him his 'magic Buddha'. Kersten presented himself after the war as a resistance hero who convinced Himmler to save countless people from mass murder. Kawashima Yoshiko, a gender fluid Manchu princess, spied for the Japanese secret police in China, and was mythologized by the Japanese as a heroic combination of Mata Hari and Joan of Arc. Friedrich Weinreb was a Hasidic Jew in Holland who took large amounts of money from fellow Jews in an imaginary scheme to save them from deportation, while in fact betraying some of them to the German secret police. Sentenced after the war as a traitor and a con artist, he is still regarded by supporters as the 'Dutch Dreyfus'. All three figures have been vilified and mythologized, out of a never-ending need, Ian Buruma argues, to see history, and particularly war, and above all World War II, as a neat tale of angels and devils. In telling their often-self-invented stories, The Collaborators offers a fascinating reconstruction of what in fact we can know about these fantasists and what will always remain out of reach. It is also an examination of the power and credibility of history: truth is always a relative concept but perhaps especially so in times of political turmoil, not unlike our own.",2023-03-09,"['biography', 'truestories', 'historical', 'political', 'militarybiographies', '', 'history', 'militaryhistory', 'secondworldwar']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-collaborators/ian-buruma/9781838957650,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8389/9781838957650.jpg

Into this warm cocoon, this big, empty house, would arrive a little baby. And soon Alice's world began to expand and contract in ways she could never have imagined. With her body struggling to recover, darker intrusions ran through the days and nights of new motherhood. For the first time, she considered the experiences of her mother, her grandmother, and the generations of women who came before them. She asked herself questions. How does this country treat its mothers? What does it mean to be forever tethered? Forever in love? Set against the backdrop of a seemingly changed Ireland, Alice draws for us her own map of motherhood, a crucial reflection spanning nine months of pregnancy and the first nine months of her child's life.

The Shortest History of India (Hardback),John Zubrzycki,"From the tantalising traces of ancient Harappan civilisation to the emerging superpower of today, here is India’s story in all its contradictions, drama and splendour. In The Shortest History of India, John Zubrzycki distils five millennia of gods and kings, conquerors and colonisers into an epic tale teeming with personalities both legendary and largely unknown outside India. Gautama Buddha, Alexander the Great and Mahatma Gandhi share the stage with Candragupta (‘India’s Julius Caesar’), Nizam Saqqa, the water-carrier who became king for a day, and Raziyya, the first Muslim woman to rule in the subcontinent.

The Curator (Hardback),Owen King,"From Sunday Times bestselling author Owen King comes a Dickensian fantasy of illusion and charm where cats are revered as religious figures, thieves are noble, scholars are revolutionaries, and conjurers the most wonderful criminals. At first glance, the world has not changed: the trams on the boulevards, the grand hotels, the cafes abuzz with conversation. The street kids still play on the two great bridges that divide the city, and the smart set still venture down to the Morgue Ship for an evening's entertainment. Yet it only takes a spark to ignite a revolution. For young Dora, a maid at the university, the moment brings liberation. She finds herself walking out with one of the student radicals, Robert, free to investigate what her brother Ambrose may have seen at the Institute for Psykical Research before he died. But it is another establishment that Dora is given to look after, The Museum of the Worker. This strange, forgotten edifice is occupied by waxwork tableaux of miners, nurses, shopkeepers and other disturbingly lifelike figures. As the revolution and counter-revolution outside unleash forces of love, betrayal, magic and terrifying darkness, Dora's search for the truth behind a mystery that she has long concealed will unravel a monstrous conspiracy and bring her to the very edge of worlds. In The Curator, Owen King has created an extraordinary time and place - historical, fantastical, yet compellingly real, and a heroine who is courageous, curious and utterly memorable.",2023-03-07,"['crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'thrillers', '', 'fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', 'sciencefiction', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'horror', 'ghoststories', 'classichorror', 'ghoststories']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-curator/owen-king/9781399715089,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/3997/9781399715089.jpg

When Akuany and her brother are orphaned in a village raid, they are taken in by a young merchant, Yaseen, who promises to care for them - a vow that tethers him to Akuany through their adulthood. As revolution begins to brew, led by the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Sudan begins to prise itself from Ottoman rule, and everyone must choose a side. Yaseen feels beholden to stand against this false Mahdi, a decision that threatens to splinter his family. Meanwhile, Akuany moves through her young adulthood and across the country alone, sold and traded from house to house, with only Yaseen as her intermittent lifeline.

The Earth Transformed: An Untold History (Hardback),Peter Frankopan,"Most people can name the influential leaders and major battles of the past. Few can name the most destructive storms, the worst winters, the most devastating droughts. In The Earth Transformed, ground-breaking historian Peter Frankopan reconnects us with our ancestors who, like us, worshipped, exploited and conserved the natural environment - and draws salutary conclusions about what the future may bring. In this revelatory book, Frankopan shows that engagement with the natural world and with climatic change and their effects on us are not new: exploring, for instance, how the development of religion and language and their relationships with the environment; tracing how growing demands for harvests resulted in the increased shipment of enslaved peoples; scrutinising how the desire to centralise agricultural surplus formed the origins of the bureaucratic state; and seeing how efforts to understand and manipulate the weather have a long and deep history. Understanding how past shifts in natural patterns have shaped history, and how our own species has shaped terrestrial, marine and atmospheric conditions is not just important but essential at a time of growing awareness of the severity of the climate crisis. Taking us from the beginning of recorded history to the present day, The Earth Transformed forces us to reckon with humankind's continuing efforts to make sense of the natural world.",2023-03-02,"['history', 'general', 'worldhistory', '', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'earthsciences', 'geography', 'environment', 'planning', 'theenvironment', 'pollution', 'threatstotheenvironment', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'earthsciences', 'geography', 'environment', 'planning', 'theenvironment', 'naturaldisasters']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-earth-transformed/professor-peter-frankopan/9781526622563,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5266/9781526622563.jpg

Wild Isles (Hardback),Patrick Barkham,"This beautifully illustrated overview of the wildlife of the British Isles showcases the diversity of our plant and animal life. Wild Isles is a celebration of the wildlife found on a relatively modest collection of islands positioned at a latitude so northerly to be unattractive to many animals and plants. Despite these unpromising foundations, the islands of Britain and Ireland, together with more than 6,000 lesser islets that make up our archipelago, contain some of the most diverse, beautiful and wildlife-rich landscapes and seas on our planet. This book will explore the fascinating relationships within and between species who make their home on our beautiful isles. Each chapter focuses on a particular kind of wild space. Britain and Ireland are dominated by a wide variety of grasslands from lowland water meadows to upland moors, and we will see how these human-shaped, semi-natural landscapes thrum with insect, bird and mammal life. Life requires water to flourish, and streams and rivers carry freshwater through our landscape, creating unique ecosystems and interrelations within and beside these waters, which are revealed in a third section. While Britain and Ireland's woodlands are comparatively thin on the ground compared with most of continental Europe, we will see some of the forests and trees that remain are unusually ancient and, great repositories of life. Finally, of course, we are surrounded by sea, and our position on the continental shelf before it plunges into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean gives rise to an often overlooked plenty of marine life. A glorious richness divided into five breathtaking sections.",2023-03-02,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', '', 'art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'arttreatments', 'subjects', 'animals', 'natureinart', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'mathematics', 'science', 'biology/lifesciences', 'zoology', 'animalsciences']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/wild-isles/patrick-barkham/alastair-fothergill/9780008359317,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0083/9780008359317.jpg
Hags: The Demonisation of Middle-Aged Women (Hardback),Victoria Smith,"What is about about women in their forties and beyond that seems to enrage - almost everyone? In the last few years, as identity politics has taken hold, middle-aged women have found themselves talked and written about as morally inferior beings, the face of bigotry, entitlement and selfishness, to be ignored, pitied or abused. Hags asks the question why these women are treated with such active disdain. Each chapter takes a different theme - care work, beauty, violence, political organization, sex - and explores it in relation to middle-aged women's beliefs, bodies and choices. Victoria Smith traces the attitudes she describes back to the same anxieties about older women that drove Early Modern witch hunts, and explores the very specific reasons why this type of misogyny is so powerful today. The demonisation of hags has never felt more now. Victoria Smith has decided in this book that she will be the Karen so nobody else has to be, and she ends on a positive note, exploring potential solutions which can benefit all women, hags and hags-in-waiting.",2023-03-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'feminism', 'feministtheory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/hags/victoria-smith/9780349726960,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/3497/9780349726960.jpg

On the Savage Side: Signed Edition (Hardback),Tiffany McDaniel,"A Standard Edition is available here Six women - mothers, daughters, sisters - gone missing. Inspired by the unsolved murders of the Chillicothe Six, this is the story of two sisters, both of whom could be the next victims. Arcade and Daffodil are twin sisters born one minute apart. With their fiery red hair and thirst for an escape, they form an unbreakable bond nurtured by their grandmother's stories. Together they disappear into their imagination and forge a world where a patch of grass reveals an archaeologist's dig, the smoke emerging from the local paper mill becomes the dust rising from wild horses galloping deep beneath the earth, and an abandoned 1950s convertible transforms into a time machine that can take them anywhere. But no matter how hard they try, Arc and Daffy can't escape the generational ghosts that haunt their family. And so, left to fend for themselves in the shadow of their rural Ohio town, the two sisters cling tight to one another. Years later, as the sisters wrestle with the memories of their early life, a local woman is discovered dead in the river. Soon, more bodies are left floating in the water, and as the killer circles ever closer, Arc's promise to keep herself and her sister safe becomes increasingly desperate - and the powerful riptide of the savage side more difficult to survive.

Wandering Souls (Hardback),Cecile Pin,"An extraordinary and heartbreaking debut novel about the bonds that connect people even when separated by seas or death itself.  There are the goodbyes and then the fishing out of the bodies - everything in between is speculation.  One night, not long after the last American troops leave Vietnam, siblings Anh, Thanh and Minh flee their village and embark on a perilous boat journey to Hong Kong. Their parents and four younger siblings make the crossing in another vessel but as weeks go by it becomes clear that only one party has survived the voyage. Anh, Thanh and Minh suddenly find themselves alone in the world, without family or home. They travel on, navigating refugee camps and resettlement centres until, by a twist of fate, they arrive in Thatcher's Britain. Here they must somehow build new lives with only each other to turn to, but will that be enough in a place that doesn't seem to want them? In this piercing debut, the siblings' faltering journey is deftly interwoven with the voice of their lost younger brother, Dao, following them from a place between the living and the dead, and the records of an unknown researcher intent on gathering the strands of their story. Revelatory and inventive, Wandering Souls paints a heart-wrenching portrait of a family in unimaginable adversity while exploring the healing power of stories.",2023-03-02,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', '', 'fiction', 'historicalfiction', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'asia']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/wandering-souls/cecile-pin/9780008528775,https://cdn.waterstones.com/override/v1/large/9780/0085/9780008528775.jpg
Cursed Bread (Hardback),Sophie Mackintosh,"From the Booker-nominated author of The Water Cure and Blue Ticket comes a chilling new feminist fable, based on the true story of an unsolved historical mystery...'If you eat the bread, you'll die, he said. The statement made no sense, but it filled me with an electric dread.'Elodie is the baker's wife. A plain, unremarkable person, largely ignored by her husband and everyone else, she burns with the secret hunger to be extraordinary, to be desired, to be seen. One day a charismatic new couple appear in town - the ambassador and his sharp-toothed wife, Violet - and Elodie quickly falls under their spell. All summer long she stalks them through the shining streets: inviting herself into their home, trying to decipher their coded conversations, longing to possess them at any cost.Meanwhile, beneath the tranquil surface of daily life, strange things are happening. Six horses are found dead in a sun-drenched field, laid out neatly on the ground like an offering. Widows see their lost husbands walking up the river in the night, coming back to claim them. A teenage boy throws himself into the bonfire at the midsummer feast. A dark intoxication is spreading through the town, and when Elodie finally understands her role in it, it will be too late to stop.Audacious and mesmerising, Cursed Bread is a fevered confession, an entry into memory's hall of mirrors, a fable of obsession and transformation. Sophie Mackintosh spins a darkly gleaming tale of a town gripped by hysteria, envy like poison in the blood, and desire that burns and consumes.",2023-03-02,"['fiction', 'historicalfiction', '', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'crime', 'mystery', 'sciencefiction', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'sciencefiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/cursed-bread/sophie-mackintosh/9780241539613,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2415/9780241539613.jpg

The Patriarchs: How Men Came to Rule (Hardback),Angela Saini,"In this bold and radical book, award-winning science journalist Angela Saini goes in search of the true roots of what we call patriarchy, uncovering a complex history of how it first became embedded in societies and spread across the globe from prehistory into the present. Travelling to the world's earliest known human settlements, analysing the latest research findings in science and archaeology, and tracing cultural and political histories from the Americas to Asia, she overturns simplistic universal theories to show that what patriarchy is and how far it goes back really depends on where you live. Despite all the push back against sexism, abuse, and discrimination in our own time, even revolutionary efforts to bring about equality have often ended in failure and backlash. Saini ends by asking what part we all play - women included - in keeping patriarchal structures alive, and why we need to look beyond the old grand narratives to understand how it persists in the present.",2023-03-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'feminism', 'feministtheory', '', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'slavery', 'abolitionofslavery']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-patriarchs/angela-saini/9780008418113,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0084/9780008418113.jpg

An undeclared, unregulated, sometimes-criminal, sometimes-philanthropic gathering of friends, this activist collective plants crops wherever no one will notice, on the sides of roads, in forgotten parks, and neglected backyards. For years, the group has struggled to break even. Then Mira stumbles on an answer, a way to finally set the group up for the long term: a landslide has closed the Korowai Pass, cutting off the town of Thorndike. Natural disaster has created an opportunity, a sizable farm seemingly abandoned. But Mira is not the only one interested in Thorndike. Robert Lemoine, the enigmatic American billionaire, has snatched it up to build his end-times bunker - or so he tells Mira when he catches her on the property. Intrigued by Mira, Birnam Wood, and their entrepreneurial spirit, he suggests they work this land. But can they trust him? And, as their ideals and ideologies are tested, can they trust each other?

Magisteria: The Entangled Histories of Science & Religion (Hardback),Nicholas Spencer,"The true history of science and religion is a human one. It's about the role of religion in inspiring, and strangling, science before the scientific revolution. It's about the sincere but eccentric faith and the quiet, creeping doubts of the most brilliant scientists in history - Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Darwin, Maxwell, Einstein. Above all it's about the question of what it means to be human and who gets to say - a question that is more urgent in the twenty-first century than ever before. From eighth-century Baghdad to the frontiers of AI today, via medieval Europe, nineteenth-century India and Soviet Russia, Magisteria sheds new light on this complex historical landscape. Rejecting the thesis that science and religion are inevitably at war, Nicholas Spencer illuminates a compelling and troubled relationship that has definitively shaped human history.",2023-03-02,"['spirituality', 'beliefs', 'religion', 'religion:general', 'religiousissues', 'debates', '', 'history', 'general', 'worldhistory', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/magisteria/nicholas-spencer/9780861544615,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/8615/9780861544615.jpg

Quartet: How Four Women Changed the Musical World (Hardback),Leah Broad,"The lives, loves, adventures and trailblazing musical careers of four extraordinary women from a stunning debut biographer. Ethel Smyth (b.1858): Famed for her operas, this trailblazing queer Victorian composer was a larger-than-life socialite, intrepid traveller and committed Suffragette. Rebecca Clarke (b.1886): This talented violist and Pre-Raphaelite beauty was one of the first women ever hired by a professional orchestra, later celebrated for her modernist experimentation. Dorothy Howell (b.1898): A prodigy who shot to fame at the 1919 Proms, her reputation as the 'English Strauss' never dented her modesty; on retirement, she tended Elgar's grave alone. Doreen Carwithen (b.1922): One of Britain's first woman film composers who scored Elizabeth II's coronation film, her success hid a 20-year affair with her married composition tutor . In their time, these women were celebrities. They composed some of the century's most popular music and pioneered creative careers; but today, they are ghostly presences, surviving only as muses and footnotes to male contemporaries like Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten - until now. Leah Broad's magnificent group biography resurrects these forgotten voices, recounting lives of rebellion, heartbreak and ambition, and celebrating their musical masterpieces.

But beneath the surface, it can be beautifully simple.In Nuts and Bolts, award-winning Shard engineer and broadcaster Roma Agrawal deconstructs our most complex feats of engineering into seven fundamental inventions: the nail, spring, wheel, lens, magnet, string and pump. Each of these objects is itself a wonder of design, the result of many iterations and refinements. Together, they have enabled humanity to see the invisible, build the spectacular, communicate across vast distances, and even escape our planet.Tracing the surprising journeys of each invention through the millennia, Roma reveals how handmade Roman nails led to modern skyscrapers, how the potter's wheel enabled space exploration, and how humble lenses helped her conceive a child against the odds.She invites us to marvel at these small but perfectly formed inventions, sharing the stories of the remarkable, and often unknown, scientists and engineers who made them possible.

The West: A New History of an Old Idea (Hardback),Naoise Mac Sweeney,"A radical new account of how the idea of the West has shaped our history, told through the stories of fourteen fascinating lives. We tend to imagine Western Civilisation as a golden thread, leading through the centuries from classical antiquity to the countries of the modern West - a cultural genealogy that connects Plato to NATO. It is an idea often invoked in the speeches of politicians and the rhetoric of journalists, and which remains deeply embedded in popular culture. But what if it is wrong? In an epic sweep through the ages, prize-winning archaeologist and historian Naoise Mac Sweeney charts the history of this idea - an idea of enormous political significance, but which is nonetheless factually incorrect and obscures the wondrous, rich diversity of our past. She reveals how this particular version of Western history was invented, how it has been used to justify imperialism and racism, and why it is no longer ideologically fit for purpose today. Told through the lives of fourteen fascinating historical figures - including a formidable Roman matriarch, an unconventional Islamic scholar, an enslaved African American poetess and a British prime minister with Homeric aspirations - The West is a groundbreaking retelling of Western history and a powerful corrective to one of the greatest myths of all: Western Civilisation.",2023-03-02,"['spirituality', 'beliefs', 'philosophy', 'historyofwesternphilosophy', '', 'history', 'historicalperiods', 'modernhistory:1700to1900', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-west/naoise-mac-sweeney/9780753558928,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/7535/9780753558928.jpg

Nothing Special (Hardback),Nicole Flattery,"In the late 1960s, Pop artist Andy Warhol set out to make an unconventional novel by following a cast of his most famous characters around New York, recording their conversations with his tape recorder. The twenty-four one-hour tapes were transcribed by four women: The Velvet Underground's drummer Maureen Tucker, a Barnard student Susan Pile, and two young women. In Nothing Special, Nicole Flattery imagines the lives of those high school students: precocious and wise beyond their years but still only teenagers, living with their mothers but working all day in the surreal and increasingly dangerous world of Andy Warhol's Factory, and learning to shape and reshape their identities as they navigate between their low-paid, grueling jobs and their lives at home, in a time of social change for girls and women in America. This blistering, mordantly funny debut interrogates the nature of fantasy and reality, voyeurism and language, and celebrity and the construction of identity. Within the framework of Andy Warhol's surreal world, Flattery asks us to consider at what point does the creation, and consumption, of our public selves turn us into something we don't recognise?",2023-03-02,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/nothing-special/nicole-flattery/9781526612120,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5266/9781526612120.jpg
Lead Sister: The Story of Karen Carpenter (Hardback),Lucy O'Brien,"When the Carpenters first toured Japan, a journalist mistakenly referred to Karen as the 'lead sister' of the band. This designation stuck and Karen liked it so much that she had a T-shirt custom-made with the slogan, which she wore while drumming on the band's 1976 world tour. The term also sums up the approach of this biography: a celebratory re-evaluation of a pioneering woman.  As one of the biggest-selling acts of the 1970s, sibling duo Richard and Karen Carpenter created lush soundscapes of melodic pop, producing global hits like 'We've Only Just Begun', 'Top of the World' and 'Close to You'. However, though Karen is rightly recognised as one of the greatest singers in popular music, the tragedy of her early death in 1983, at the age of just thirty-two, often overshadows all that she achieved. She has long been portrayed as a victim, controlled by her family and exploited by the music industry.  This book now seeks to reframe her life and legacy.  Through fresh interviews with friends, musicians and co-workers, bestselling author Lucy O'Brien's fascinating profile explores Karen's contributions in the studio as a singer, drummer, arranger and producer, as well as tracing the roots of the Carpenters' sound and of Karen's distinctive vocals. Forty years after her death, it also honours the lead sister's achievements in the face of her struggle with anorexia, as viewed through the lens of new perspectives on eating disorders and mental health.  Yet, despite the chronic nature of her illness, Karen Carpenter was, above all, a creative, dedicated and assured artist whose music delivers an emotional resonance that has transcended generations - and that is how she should be remembered.",2023-03-02,"['entertainment', 'music', 'musicalstyles', 'genres', 'rock', 'pop', '', 'entertainment', 'music', 'musicalstyles', 'genres', 'biography', 'truestories', 'arts', 'entertainmentbiographies']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/lead-sister/lucy-obrien/9781788708241,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7887/9781788708241.jpg

"UPROAR!: Satire, Scandal and Printmakers in Georgian London (Hardback)",Alice Loxton,"London, 1772: a young artist called Thomas Rowlandson is making his way through the grimy backstreets of the capital, on his way to begin his studies at the Royal Academy Schools. Within a few years, James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank would join him in Piccadilly, turning satire into an artform, taking on the British establishment, and forever changing the way we view power. Set against a backdrop of royal madness, political intrigue, the birth of modern celebrity, French revolution, American independence and the Napoleonic Wars, UPROAR! follows the satirists as they lampoon those in power, from the Prince Regent to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Their prints and illustrations deconstruct the political and social landscape with surreal and razor-sharp wit, as the three men vie with each other to create the most iconic images of the day.Alice Loxton's writing fizzes with energy on every page, and never fails to convince us that Gillray and his gang profoundly altered British humour, setting the stage for everything from Gilbert and Sullivan to Private Eye and Spitting Image today.

When a man's brutally disfigured body is discovered in the ruins of an ancient almshouse, architect Cat Hakesby is ordered to stop restoration work. It is obvious he has been murdered, and Whitehall secretary James Marwood is ordered to investigate. It's possible the victim could be one of two local men who have vanished - the first, a feckless French tutor connected to the almshouse's owner;the second, a possibly treacherous employee of the Council of Foreign Plantations. The pressure on Marwood mounts as Charles II's most influential courtiers, Lord Arlington and the Duke of Buckingham, show an interest in his activities - and Marwood soon begins to suspect the murder trail may lead right to the heart of government.

The Hidden Fires: A Cairngorms Journey with Nan Shepherd (Hardback),Merryn Glover,"Elemental, fierce and full of wonder, the Cairngorm mountains are the high and rocky heart of Scotland. To know them would take forever, to love them demands a kind of courageous surrender. In The Hidden Fires, Merryn Glover undertakes that challenge with Nan Shepherd as companion and guiding light. Following in the footsteps and contours of The Living Mountain, she explores the same landscapes and themes as Shepherd's seminal work. This is a journey separated by time but unified by space and purpose, a conversation between two women across nearly a century that explores how entering the life of a mountain can illuminate our own. An Australian who grew up in the Himalayas, her early experiences of the Scottish hills and weather left her cold. But gradually acclimatising and with an approach like Shepherd's, that is more mountain wandering than mountaineering, she discovers the spark that sets the hills and herself on fire. Through Glover's deepening encounter, the wild majesty and iridescence of the Cairngorms is revealed in this beautiful evocation of landscape, place and identity.",2023-03-02,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', '', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'mind', 'body', 'spirit', 'popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', 'thecountryside', 'countrylife']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-hidden-fires/merryn-glover/9781846975752,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8469/9781846975752.jpg

A man's sudden, intense Catholic piety provokes his wife. A mother and daughter struggle to come to terms with the disease that intensifies an already dependent relationship. At their root, these existential dilemmas grow out of long-established patterns of behaviour that bind together patients and caregivers. Travellers to Unimaginable Lands explores the complex and profound psychology of caregiving, illuminating how the healthy brain's biases and intuitions make caring for people with dementia disorders so profoundly and inherently difficult.

"Woman's Lore: 4,000 Years of Sirens, Serpents and Succubi (Hardback)",Sarah Clegg,"The history of a demonic tradition that was stolen from women - and then won back again. Creatures like Lilith, the seductive first wife of Adam, and mermaids, who lured sailors to their death, are familiar figures in the genre of monstrous temptresses who use their charms to entice men to their doom. But if we go back 4,000 years, the roots of these demons lie in horrific creatures like Lamashtu, a lion-headed Mesopotamian demon who strangled infants and murdered pregnant women, and Gello, a virgin ghost of ancient Greece who killed expectant mothers and babies out of jealousy. Far from enticing men into danger and destruction, these monsters were part of women's ritual practices surrounding childbirth and pregnancy. So how did their mythology evolve into one focused on the seduction of men? Sarah Clegg takes us on an absorbing and witty journey from ancient Mesopotamia to the present day, encountering a multitude of serpentine succubi, a child-eating wolf-monster of ancient Greece, the Queen of Sheba and a host of vampires. Clegg shows how these demons were appropriated by male-centred societies, before they were eventually recast as symbols of women's liberation, offering new insights into attitudes towards womanhood, sexuality and women's rights.",2023-03-02,"['history', 'historicalperiods', '', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'feminism', 'feministtheory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/womans-lore/sarah-clegg/9781803280271,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8032/9781803280271.jpg
Mother Tongue: Flavours of a Second Generation (Hardback),Gurdeep Loyal,"Filled with vibrant and lively recipes, Mother Tongue celebrates and explores the multitudes of second-generation British-Indian identity through food. Born in Britain to Indian parents, Gurdeep never felt fully on the inside of either culture. But it was through his love and passion of food and cooking that he was able to embrace and understand the dichotomies of his hyphenated identity. Mother Tongue explores what happens when your culinary education combines 'authentic' home-cooked Punjabi food, with 'inauthentic' curry-house Tikka Masalas, the European foodie cannon, and a wanderlust for travel in pursuit of flavour, each in equal measure. The result is a hybrid cuisine that exists in the middle-ground as a delicious self-expression of British-Indian identity today - characterised by ingredient combinations that inhabit the grey areas in between so-called cultural boundaries. This vibrantly spiced, flavour-amplified, third-culture cuisine creates with it a spectrum of possibilities for home-cooks to explore and be inspired by every day.",2023-03-02,"['food', 'drink', 'generalcookery', 'recipes', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/mother-tongue/gurdeep-loyal/9780008464547,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0084/9780008464547.jpg

One Medicine: How understanding animals can save our lives (Hardback),Dr Matt Morgan,"It all started with a Hob Nob. As Dr Matt Morgan, an intensive care consultant, examined a patient who had suffered a cardiac arrest after inhaling some biscuit crumbs, he saw a flock of birds fly past the window. They must inhale objects all the time when flying, how do they survive? he thought to himself. This began an investigation that spanned continents, species and millennia.  For animal science has so much to teach us about human medicine. While some of the overlaps and parallels are obvious - we know how much DNA we share with primates, the first pig heart has been transplanted into a human - there is so much more that we have learnt from the animal world. For example, studying kangaroos, in particular the female's three vaginas, has improved in-vitro fertilisation success rates. Watching how a giraffe breathes can help save the life of someone struggling with asthma. Investigating why birds that live in the frozen Arctic circle don't freeze to death led to advances with treating hypothermia. Getting a ECG on the 150kg heart of a humpback whale was instrumental to keeping patients with cardiac failure living longer.  We owe animals so much, it's time to focus on examining how they live and what we still have to learn from them. Better shared understanding of how our species coexists with millions of others can lead to untold medical advances, help both humans and animals and improve the world for all creatures from single-celled bacteria to a 30,000 kg whale.

The Real Work: On the Mystery of Mastery (Hardback),Adam Gopnik,"Bestselling author and New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik embarks on a wildly creative inquiry into perhaps the oldest question: how do we learn a new skill?  For decades, Adam Gopnik has been one of our most beloved writers, a brilliantly perceptive critic of art, food, France, and more. But recently, he became obsessed by a fundamental matter: how did the people he was writing about learn their outlandish skill, whether it was drawing a nude or baking a sourdough loaf? In The Real Work-the term magicians use for the accumulated craft that makes for a great trick-Gopnik apprentices himself to an artist, a dancer, a boxer, and even a driving instructor (from the DMV), among others, trying his late-middle-age hand at things he assumed were beyond him. He finds that mastering a skill is a process of methodically breaking down and building up, piece by piece-and that true mastery, in any field, requires mastering other people's minds. Exuberant and profound, The Real Work is ultimately about why we relentlessly seek to better ourselves in the first place.PRAISE FOR ADAM GOPNIK'A real treat . . .

When one is asked what they do for a living, their response is met with: 'That's amazing, you are so brave!', while the other is asked: 'Isn't that dangerous? Aren't you scared? What about your kids?' Can you guess the difference between the two? These comments are the reality for Dr Sabrina Cohen-Hatton and many other women at work and in life. Gender biases stop women from succeeding - but why are certain qualities associated with success viewed less favourably for women? After leaving home at 15, going through extreme personal adversity and a period of homelessness, Sabrina gained first-hand experience of the hurdles women face to become successful. In The Gender Bias, she explores the everyday prejudices women experience through the prism of success. From leadership, to risk-taking, perception and failure, Sabrina exposes the invisible barriers that are holding women back.

Worthy Opponents (Hardback),Danielle Steel,"Worthy Opponents is a riveting and dynamic tale of family, wealth and success from the Number One bestselling author, Danielle Steel. Spencer Brooke had grown up knowing that one day she would own and run Brooke's, one of New York's most respected department stores. Established in 1920 by Spencer's grandfather, it was known for the highest quality merchandise and beautifully designed pieces from all the luxury brands in Europe. Brooke's was an unexpected jewel in downtown Manhattan, and it was in Spencer's blood to ensure she navigated its safe and successful passage through twenty-first-century competition. The death of Spencer's grandfather left a terrible void in her life, making her feel vulnerable and causing her to rush into an unsuitable marriage. Shocked after finding herself pregnant with twins just weeks after the wedding, but knowing in her heart she could be a wife and mother as well as a successful CEO, pressure from Bart to sell the store led to the breakdown of the marriage. Devoting herself to her twin sons together with the pressure of running Brookes, Spencer had little time for a social life.

Culture: A new world history (Hardback),Martin Puchner,"Can anyone really own a culture? This magnificent account argues that the story of global civilisations is one of mixing, sharing, and borrowing. It shows how art forms have crisscrossed continents over centuries to produce masterpieces. From Nefertiti's lost city and the Islamic Golden Age to twentieth century Nigerian theatre and Modernist poetry, Martin Puchner explores how contact between different peoples has driven artistic innovation in every era - whilst cultural policing and purism have more often undermined the very societies they tried to protect. Travelling through Classical Greece, Ashoka's India, Tang dynasty China, and many other epochs, this triumphal new history reveals the crossing points which have not only inspired the humanities, but which have made us human.",2023-03-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'culturalstudies', 'historyofideas', '', 'art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'art:generalissues', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/culture/martin-puchner/9781804182536,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8041/9781804182536.jpg

Trust the Plan: The Rise of Qanon and the Conspiracy That Reshaped the World (Hardback),Will Sommer,"On the 6th of January, 2021 thousands of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol. Their banners read, Trust the Plan, a reference to an alarming conspiracy theory that had gained unstoppable momentum over the last four years: these were followers of QAnon. Decoding online clues from a mysterious figure - who has claimed to be a high-level government insider - QAnon adherents believe that Donald Trump has been anointed by God to stop a depraved deep state government, that sexually abuse, kill, and eat children. But QAnon has also become a broad church of out-there beliefs, offering a welcoming community to anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, eugenicists and white nationalists. With first hand access to the leading figures in the movement, investigative journalist Will Sommer unpacks the bizarre story of how a post from one of the darkest corners of the internet, became a belief system for millions; how politicians cozied up to extremists; how an unwavering trust in these ideas tore apart families, caused a mafia boss's assassination, and threatened democracy. Trust the Plan is a timely and essential look on how the internet radicalised our politics, and how millions were convinced to believe the unbelievable.",2023-03-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'popularbeliefs', 'controversialknowledge', 'conspiracytheories', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', 'politicalstructure', 'processes', 'politicalleaders', 'leadership', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', 'politicalcorruption']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/trust-the-plan/will-sommer/9780008466763,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0084/9780008466763.jpg
The Norse Myths that Shape the Way We Think (Hardback),Carolyne Larrington,"A fresh look at the stories at the heart of Norse mythology, exploring their cultural impact right up to the present day. The heroes and villains of Norse mythology have endured for centuries, infiltrating art, opera, film, television and books, shape-shifting - like the trickster Loki - to suit the cultures that encountered them. Through careful analysis of the literature and archaeology of the Norse world, Carolyne Larrington takes us deep into the realm described in the Icelandic sagas, from the gloomy halls of Hel to the dazzling heights of Asgard. She expertly examines the myths' many modern-day reimaginings, revealing the guises that have been worn by the figures of Norse myth, including Marvel's muscled, golden-haired Thor and George R.R Martin's White Walkers, who march inexorably southwards, bringing their eternal winter with them. This sophisticated yet accessible guide explores how these powerful stories have inspired our cultural landscape, from fuelling the creative genius of Wagner to the construction of the Nazi's nationalist ideology. Larrington's elegantly written retellings capture the essence of the original myths while also delving into the history of their meanings. The myths continue to speak to such modern concerns as masculinity and environmental disaster - after the inevitable, apocalyptic ragna roek, renewal comes from the roots of Yggdrasill, the World Tree.",2023-03-02,"['history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'europe']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-norse-myths-that-shape-the-way-we-think/carolyne-larrington/9780500252345,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/5002/9780500252345.jpg

The State of Us: The good news and the bad news about our society (Hardback),Jon Snow,"A vital call to arms by one of the nation's pre-eminent broadcast journalists. We are living through a time of tremendous upheaval. Society is growing ever more unequal, and elites increasingly detached, with the Honourable Members ensconced in their Upper and Lower Houses. Jon Snow's own wake up call was the Grenfell Tower fire when, gazing up at the smoke still pouring from the building in the early hours, he felt the weight of the obligation as a journalist to understand what had happened. Tracing key moments in his incredible career, from getting thrown out of university for protesting apartheid to his reporting on major global developments everywhere from America to Iran, Snow argues that the greatest problems at home and abroad so often come down to inequality and an unwillingness to confront it. One of the few ways that we can challenge unfairness is by getting the news out, but traditional media have been facing their own battles recently, with local news collapsing and big tech companies decimating revenues. We can do better: the time in which we live is undeniably full of challenges, but it is also full of potential. If we begin by telling the truth about our situation and then do something about it, the coming years have the potential to be a new golden age.",2023-03-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'arts', 'entertainmentbiographies', 'arts', 'entertainmentautobiographies', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'mediastudies']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-state-of-us/jon-snow/9781787635708,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7876/9781787635708.jpg
A Love That Kills: Stories of Forensic Psychology and Female Violence (Hardback),Anna Motz,"Female violence is a truth too uncomfortable for most to consider. We treat those who kill, abuse and commit terrible acts as outcasts - they are monsters, angels of death, manifestations of pure evil and a threat to the ideals of womanhood.In reality, the truth can be much more complex. Many women who commit acts of violence have been subjected to shocking abuse themselves. Some are suffering from serious mental illness or psychological harm. For many, the desperate search for the care they have been denied their whole lives leads them to repeat the same brutality they once suffered. Women like this are not the inhuman monsters of tabloid myth, but victims and proponents of abuse motivated by the most human instinct of all: to love and be loved.Introducing us to eleven ordinary women who came to commit extreme acts, Anna Motz - one of Britain's leading forensic psychotherapists who has spent three decades working with violent women - takes us on a journey into psychotherapy, uncovering their motives and the fault lines in their psyche that led to their crimes. We meet Mary, who turned to arson after her son was taken into care, Maja, whose fantasy life led to her stalking an ex-boyfriend, and Dolores, whose terrible crime is unimaginable to most people. Deeply affecting, compelling and profound, A Love That Kills offers a rare insight into the sometimes perilous dance between therapist and patient and the often tortuous pathways to recovery, asking vital questions about how society treats violent women.",2023-03-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'psychology', 'clinicalpsychology', 'psychotherapy', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'truecrime']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/a-love-that-kills/anna-motz/9781474624343,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4746/9781474624343.jpg

It is the crucible of womanhood, together with the harassment, physical abuse and eating disorders endemic at top schools. Can we abide this in a post #MeToo world? Weaving together her own time at America's most elite ballet school with the lives of renowned ballerinas throughout history, Alice Robb interrogates what it means to perform ballet today. She confronts the all-consuming nature of the form: the obsessive and dangerous practices to perfect the body, the embrace of submission and the idealisation of suffering. Yet ballet also gifts its dancers 'brains in their toes', a way to fully inhabit their bodies and a sanctuary of control away from the pressures of the outside world.

Catfish Rolling (Hardback),Clara Kumagai,"A dazzling debut. Magic-realism blends with Japanese myth and legend in an original story about grief, memory, time and an earthquake that shook a nation. There's a catfish under the islands of Japan and when it rolls the land rises and falls. Sora hates the catfish whose rolling caused an earthquake so powerful it cracked time itself. It destroyed her home and took her mother. Now Sora and her scientist father live close to the zones - the wild and abandoned places where time runs faster or slower than normal. Sora is sensitive to the shifts, and her father recruits her help in exploring these liminal spaces. But it's dangerous there - and as she strays further inside in search of her mother, she finds that time distorts, memories fracture and shadows, a glimmer of things not entirely human, linger. After Sora's father goes missing, she has no choice but to venture into uncharted spaces within the time zones to find him, her mother and perhaps even the catfish itself... Stylish, accomplished and thought-provoking story-telling explores themes of identity, philosophy, science, ecology, life, loss and love.

Then there are rowing craft or power-driven vessels which can also be considered 'classics', whether they were built for work or leisure. As he traces the iconic forms of a selection of the boats of Scotland, Ian Stephen outlines the purposes of craft, past and present, to help gain a true understanding of this vital part of our culture.

Berry openly recounts her own uncomfortable and sometimes frightening experiences as a woman to try to understand how we navigate our fears when threat can seem constant. Through it all, Berry finds new expressions for courage and survival: how to be a brave human and animal member of our fragile, often dangerous world.",2023-03-02,"['spirituality', 'beliefs', 'philosophy', 'popularphilosophy', '', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'philosophy', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'animals', 'society']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/wolfish/erica-berry/9781838854591,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8388/9781838854591.jpg

In fact, as Ben Wilson reveals in this captivating re-examination of urban landscapes around the world, nature has always been at the heart of the city.Urban Jungle explores the wild side of cities past, present and future: the middens, abandoned sites and strips of land alongside railway lines. For much of history, wild patches in cities provided essential food, fuel, medicine and places of recreation and escape for city-dwellers, and the dividing line between city and countryside was blurred. Even our post-industrial cities are much wilder places that we imagine, with booming animal and plant populations - if we know where to look. On today's urbanised planet, natural forces - be they floods, storms, droughts or pandemics - look set to determine the future of our cities. In a time of climate crisis, cities that once built walls and towers to defend against attack now have to become greener to protect themselves from external threats.Our future - and that of the planet - will be made in the city.

Time to Think: The Inside Story of the Collapse of the Tavistock's Gender Service for Children (Hardback),Hannah Barnes,"Time to Think goes behind the headlines to reveal the truth about the NHS's flagship gender service for children. The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), based at the Tavistock and Portman Trust in North London, was set up initially to provide - for the most part - talking therapies to young people who were questioning their gender identity. But in the last decade GIDS has referred more than a thousand children, some as young as nine years old, for medication to block their puberty. In the same period, the number of young people seeking GIDS's help exploded, increasing twenty-five-fold. The profile of the patients changed too: from largely pre-pubescent boys to mostly adolescent girls, who were often contending with other difficulties. Why had the patients changed so dramatically? Were all these distressed young people best served by taking puberty blockers and then cross-sex hormones, which cause irreversible changes to the body? While some young people appeared to thrive after taking the blocker, many seemed to become worse. Was there enough clinical evidence to justify such profound medical interventions in the lives of young people who had so much else to contend with? This urgent, scrupulous and dramatic book explains how, in the words of some former staff, GIDS has been the site of a serious medical scandal, in which ideological concerns took priority over clinical practice. Award-winning journalist Hannah Barnes has had unprecedented access to thousands of pages of documents, including internal emails and unpublished reports, and well over a hundred hours of personal testimony from GIDS clinicians, former service users and senior Tavistock figures. The result is a disturbing and gripping parable for our times.",2023-02-23,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'psychology', 'psychologyofgender', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialgroups', 'genderstudies', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialgroups', 'agegroups']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/time-to-think/hannah-barnes/9781800751118,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8007/9781800751118.jpg

Paul Johnson and the enormously respected Institute for Fiscal Studies aim to hold Government to account - without which politicians will get away with their half-truths, elisions and dubious claims.This is a forensic examination - by the man best placed to do so - of the GBP1 trillion it now costs to run the United Kingdom's economy. To follow the money. To provide an explanation, of where that money comes from and where it goes to, how that has changed and how it needs to change.Government decisions determine the welfare of the poor and the elderly, the state of the health service, the effectiveness of our children's education, and how prepared we are for the future: whether that is a pandemic or global warming. As a society, we are a reflection of what the government spends.Johnson looks at what happened following the financial crisis of 2008-09 and the austerity years that followed. He examines the way that the government tackled the economy during Covid - when the UK budget shot up to over a trillion for the first time - and he analyses prospects for our future as we grapple with looming recession and the cost of living crisis.",2023-02-23,"['business', 'finance', 'law', 'economics', 'macroeconomics', '', 'business', 'finance', 'law', 'economics']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/follow-the-money/paul-johnson/9781408714010,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4087/9781408714010.jpg
Medieval Horizons: Why the Middle Ages Matter (Hardback),Ian Mortimer,"The essential introduction to the Middle Ages by the bestselling author of The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England. We tend to think of the Middle Ages as a dark, backward and unchanging time characterised by violence, ignorance and superstition. By contrast we believe progress arose from science and technological innovation, and that inventions of recent centuries created the modern world. We couldn't be more wrong. As Ian Mortimer shows in this fascinating book, people's horizons - their knowledge, experience and understanding of the world - expanded dramatically. Life was utterly transformed between 1000 and 1600, marking the transition from a warrior-led society to that of Shakespeare. Just as The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England revealed what it was like to live in the fourteenth century, Medieval Horizons provides the perfect primer to the era as a whole. It outlines the enormous cultural changes that took place - from literacy to living standards, inequality and even the developing sense of self - thereby correcting misconceptions and presenting the period as a revolutionary age of fundamental importance in the development of the Western world.",2023-02-23,"['history', 'historicalperiods', 'medievalhistory', '', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'britain', 'ireland', 'history', 'historicalperiods', 'earlyhistory:500to1500']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/medieval-horizons/ian-mortimer/9781847927446,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8479/9781847927446.jpg

Life in Her Hands: The Inspiring Story of a Pioneering Female Surgeon (Hardback),Averil Mansfield,"'We were occasionally expected to travel by ambulance to a serious case and would always have a kit of tools and drugs ready for emergency calls. On one occasion, we were responding to a man who had fallen into the hold of a grain ship and broken his leg. I was expected to go down a pole into the ship to administer analgaesia before he could be rescued.' 'The 'audience' of shipworkers delighted in telling me that there were rats the size of dogs down in the grain. The other problem was that this was the era of the mini skirt, and you can imagine what that meant.' 'Following the incident, I instituted the purchase of some 'Casualty Officers Emergency Dungarees' as an addition to the kit.' Averil Mansfield established herself as a pioneer in every sense of the word when she qualified as a surgeon in the early 1970s. At the time just two per cent of her colleagues were female, and she was often met with surprise, bordering on disbelief and amusement, when telling people what she did. But time and again, Averil proved herself more than capable of the role which had been her greatest dream since the age of eight. After a formidable operating career in Liverpool and London, during which she made many enduring friendships, she went on to became the UK's first ever female professor of surgery. Life in Her Hands is the remarkable story of a truly trailblazing woman. Averil's account shines light on a medical and societal world that has changed beyond measure, but which - as she shows through her experiences - still has a long way to go for the women finding their place within it.",2023-02-23,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'medicine', 'surgery']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-in-her-hands/averil-mansfield/9781529149968,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5291/9781529149968.jpg
I Have Some Questions For You (Hardback),Rebecca Makkai,"A successful film professor and podcaster, Bodie Kane is content to forget her past: the family tragedy that marred her adolescence, her four largely miserable years at a New Hampshire boarding school, and the 1995 murder of a classmate, Thalia Keith. Though the circumstances surrounding Thalia's death and the conviction of the school's athletics coach, Omar Evans, are the subject of intense fascination online, Bodie prefers-needs-to let sleeping dogs lie. But when The Granby School invites her back to teach a two-week course, Bodie finds herself inexorably drawn to the case and its increasingly apparent flaws. In their rush to convict Omar, did the school and the police overlook other suspects? Is the real killer still out there? As she falls down the very rabbit hole she was so determined to avoid, Bodie begins to wonder if she wasn't as much of an outsider at Granby as she'd thought-if, perhaps, back in 1995, she knew something that might have held the key to solving the case. One of the most acclaimed contemporary American writers, Rebecca Makkai reinvents herself with each of her brilliant novels.

Then, on the Ionian coast, a Greek philosopher named Anaximander set in motion a revolution. He not only conceived that the Earth floats in space, but also that animals evolve, that storms and earthquakes are natural, not supernatural, that the world can be mapped and, above all, that progress is made by the endless search for knowledge.

The Dress Diary of Mrs Anne Sykes: Secrets from a Victorian Woman's Wardrobe (Hardback),Kate Strasdin,"The hidden fabric of a Victorian woman's life - from family and friends to industry and Empire - told through her unique textile scrapbook. In 1838, a young woman was given a diary on her wedding day. Collecting snippets of fabric from a range of garments she carefully annotated each one, creating a unique record of her life and times. Her name was Mrs Anne Sykes. Nearly two hundred years later, the diary fell into the hands of Kate Strasdin, a fashion historian and museum curator. Strasdin spent the next six years unravelling the secrets contained within the album's pages. Piece by piece, she charts Anne's journey from the mills of Lancashire to the port of Singapore before tracing her return to England in later years. Fragments of cloth become windows into Victorian life: pirates in Borneo, the complicated etiquette of mourning, poisonous dyes, the British Empire in full swing, rioting over working conditions and the terrible human cost of Britain's cotton industry. This is life writing that celebrates ordinary people: the hidden figures, the participants in everyday life.

And local school teacher Catherine Evans has made writing the definitive account of what happened when Ilsbeth Clark drowned in the well her life's work. The town's people may not want their past raked up, but Catherine is determined to shine a light upon that shameful event. For Ilsbeth was an innocent, after all. She was shunned and ostracised by rumour-mongers and ill-wishers and someone has to speak up for her. And who better than Catherine, who has herself felt the sting and hurt of such whisperings? But then a childhood friend returns to F -. Elena is a successful author whose book, The Whispers Inside: A Reawakening of the Soul, has earned her a certain celebrity. In search of a new subject, she takes an interest in the story of Ilsbeth Clark and announces her intention to write a book about the long-dead woman, focusing on the natural magic she believes she possessed. And Elena has everything Catherine has not, like a platform and connections and no one seems to care that Elena's book will be pure speculation, tainting Ilsbeth's memory rather than preserving it. Catherine is determined that something must be done and plots to blunt her rival's pen. However she had not allowed for the fact that the past might not be so dead after all - that something is reaching out from the well, disturbing her reality. Before summer's over, one woman will be dead, the other accused of murder . . . but is she really guilty, or are there other forces at work? And who was Ilsbeth Clark, really? An innocent? A witch?

"A Small Town in Ukraine: The place we came from, the place we went back to (Hardback)",Bernard Wasserstein,"Decades ago, the historian Bernard Wasserstein set out to uncover the hidden past of the town forty miles west of Lviv where his family originated: Krakowiec (Krah-KOV-yets).

"Unprocessed: How the Food We Eat Is Fuelling Our Mental Health Crisis 'This book will change lives' - Tim Spector, author of Food For Life (Hardback)",Kimberley Wilson,"'Explores the profound link between the food we eat and the way we think and feel' Radio 4 Start the Week'A powerful book that breaks down the dangerous beliefs that food is just fuel and delivers an important message we can all get behind...  the evidence Kimberley presents in this book will change lives and hopefully policy' - Professor Tim SpectorWe all know that as a nation our mental health is in crisis. But what most don't know is that a critical ingredient in this debate, and a crucial part of the solution - what we eat - is being ignored.Nutrition has more influence on what we feel, who we become and how we behave than we could ever have imagined. It affects everything from our decision-making to aggression and violence. Yet mental health disorders are overwhelmingly treated as 'mind' problems as if the physical brain - and how we feed it - is irrelevant. Someone suffering from depression is more likely to be asked about their relationship with their mother than their relationship with food.In this eye-opening and impassioned book, psychologist Kimberley Wilson draws on startling new research - as well as her own work in prisons, schools and hospitals around the country - to reveal the role of food and nutrients in brain development and mental health: from how the food a woman eats during pregnancy influences the size of her baby's brain, and hunger makes you mean; to how nutrient deficiencies change your personality.We must also recognise poor nutrition as a social injustice, with the poorest and most vulnerable being systematically ignored. We need to talk about what our food is doing to our brains. And we need decisive action, not over rehearsed soundbites and empty promises, from those in power - because if we don't, things can only get worse.",2023-02-23,"['science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'medicine', 'medicine:generalissues', 'publichealth', 'preventivemedicine', '', 'business', 'finance', 'law', 'industry', 'industrialstudies', 'manufacturingindustries', 'foodmanufacturing', 'relatedindustries', 'business', 'finance', 'law', 'law', 'sociallaw', 'publichealth', 'safetylaw']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/unprocessed/kimberley-wilson/9780753559741,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/7535/9780753559741.jpg

Drawing on decades of work in philosophy including a huge range of interviews with contemporary philosophers, Julian Baggini sets out how philosophical thought can promote incisive thinking. Introducing everyday examples and contemporary political concerns - from climate change to implicit bias - How to Think Like a Philosopher is a revelatory exploration of the techniques, methods and principles that guide philosophy, and how they can be applied to our own lives.

Why We Sing (Hardback),Julia Hollander,"'A must-read for anyone moved by the power of song' - Lesley Garrett, CBESinging has always been there for us, at the root of what it is to be a human being. Through personal anecdote and scientific fact-finding, this book celebrates the way song inspires and heals us, from the cradle to the grave, and in the process does for singing what The Well-Gardened Mind did for nature, and what Why We Eat did for our diets.As a singing therapist, teacher and performer, Julia Hollander is in a unique position to consider singing's importance to our wellbeing, charting its extraordinary influence on all aspects of our spiritual, emotional and physical lives. Why do parents feel compelled to sing to their newborns, and how does it help their development? What is it about song that brings communities together in harmony but also in protest? How come an activity that helps to embed languages and maths formulae can also be used to rehabilitate Long Covid sufferers? And what magic is at work when people who have lost the power to speak are still able to sing?

City of Nightmares (Hardback),Rebecca Schaeffer,"Face your fear... or become your nightmare. Ever since her sister became a man-eating spider and slaughtered her way through town, nineteen-year-old Ness has been terrified - terrified of some other Nightmare murdering her, and terrified of ending up like her sister. Because in Newham, the city that never sleeps, dreaming means waking up as your worst fear. Whether that means becoming a Nightmare that's monstrous only in appearance, or transforming into a twisted, unrecognizable creature that terrorizes the city, no one is safe. Ness will do anything to avoid becoming another victim, even if that means lying low among the Friends of the Restful Soul, a questionable organization that may or may not be a cult. But being a member of this maybe-cult has a price. In order to prove herself, Ness cons her way into what's supposed to be a simple job for the organization - only for it to blow up in her face. Literally. Tangled up in the aftermath of an explosive assassination, now Ness and the only other survivor - a Nightmare boy who Ness suspects is planning to eat her - must find their way back to Newham and uncover the sinister truth behind the attack, even as the horrors of her past loom ominously near.",2023-02-23,"[""children's"", 'teenage', 'fiction', 'fantasy', '', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'mind', 'body', 'spirit', 'paranormal', 'unexplainedphenomena', 'monsters', 'legendarybeings', ""children's"", 'teenage', 'fiction', 'generalfiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/city-of-nightmares/rebecca-schaeffer/9781399712101,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/3997/9781399712101.jpg
Other Women (Hardback),Emma Flint,"Mesmerising, haunting and utterly remarkable, this is a devastating story of fantasy, obsession inspired by a murder that took place almost a hundred years ago. In a lonely cottage on a deserted stretch of shore, a moment of tragedy between lovers becomes a horrific murder. And two women who should never have met are connected for ever. Six years after the end of the Great War, a nation is still in mourning. Thousands of husbands, fathers, sons and sweethearts were lost in Europe; millions more came back wounded and permanently damaged. Beatrice Cade is an orphan, unmarried and childless - and given the dearth of men, likely to remain that way. London is full of women like her: not wives, not widows, not mothers. There is no name for these invisible women, and no place for their grief. Determined to carve out a richer and more fulfilling way to live as a single woman, Bea takes a room in a Bloomsbury ladies' club and a job in the City. Then a fleeting encounter changes everything. Bea's emerging independence is destroyed when she falls in love for the first time. Kate Ryan is an ordinary wife and mother who has managed to build an enviable life with her handsome husband and her daughter. To anyone looking in from the outside, they seem like a normal, happy family - until two policemen knock on her door one morning and threaten to destroy the facade Kate has created.",2023-02-23,"['crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'crime', 'mystery', 'historicalmysteries', '', 'fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'crime', 'mystery', 'classiccrime']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/other-women/emma-flint/9781509840540,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5098/9781509840540.jpg

Elderflora: A Modern History of Ancient Trees (Hardback),Jared Farmer,"The stories of the planet's oldest trees and what they have meant to human beings.Humans have always revered long-lived trees. But as historian Jared Farmer reveals in Elderflora, our veneration took a modern turn in the eighteenth century when naturalists embarked on a quest to locate and precisely date the oldest living things on earth. The new science of tree time prompted travellers to visit ancient specimens and conservationists to protect sacred groves. Exploitation accompanied sanctification, as old-growth forests succumbed to imperial expansion and the industrial revolution.Taking us from Lebanon to New Zealand to California, Farmer surveys the complex history of the world's oldest trees, including voices of Indigenous peoples, religious figures, and contemporary scientists who study elderflora in crisis. In a changing climate, a long future is still possible, Farmer shows, but only if we give care to young things that might grow old.Combining rigorous scholarship with lyrical writing, Elderflora chronicles the complex roles ancient trees have played in the modern world and illuminates how we might need old trees now more than ever.",2023-02-23,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', 'trees', 'wildflowers', 'plants']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/elderflora/jared-farmer/9781035009046,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/0350/9781035009046.jpg

From juice cleanses to face rollers, we are sold breezy fixes to long-term social problems that manifest in us as burnout, disillusionment and stress. Yet, more than ever, many of us are feeling the consequences of these empty promises and are looking for a meaningful solution. Now, psychiatrist and women's mental health specialist Dr. Pooja Lakshmin offers a sustainable practice for real self-care: an ongoing internal process that puts us in the driver's seat of our own lives. Because real self-care isn't something to buy - it's a way to be. This is Pooja's answer to the scores of women who feel let down by our culture and come to her seeking help. Real self-care requires setting boundaries, treating yourself with compassion, making choices aligned with your values and asserting your power. When we practice it, we see changes in our relationships, our families, our workplaces - and our broken systems. The result - reconnecting with ourself and having ownership over our life - is nothing less than a personal and social revolution.",2023-02-23,"['health', 'lifestyle', 'popularpsychology', 'assertiveness', 'motivation', 'self-esteem', '', 'health', 'lifestyle', 'popularmedicine', 'health', ""women'shealth"", 'health', 'lifestyle', 'copingwithpersonalproblems', 'stress']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/real-self-care/pooja-lakshmin/9781529900095,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5299/9781529900095.jpg

Where a handful of oligarchs have never had it so good, with more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes, and the vast majority struggle to survive. Where a decent standard of living for all seems like an impossible dream. How can we accept an economic order that allows three billionaires to control more wealth than the bottom half of our society? How can we accept a political system that allows the super-rich to buy elections and politicians? How can we accept an energy system that rewards the fossil fuel corporations causing the climate crisis? How can we let it happen any longer? We must demand fundamental economic and political change. This is where the path forward begins. It's OK To Be Angry About Capitalism presents a vision of what would be possible if the political revolution took place.

In 2018, twenty-four members of Gulchehra Hoja's family, including her elderly parents, were arrested by the Chinese state. Gulchehra had been forced to leave her family behind when she fled to a new life in the United States, and the arrests were an act of retaliation against her investigations for Radio Free Asia into the plight of the Uyghur people.

In her stunning memoir, Gulchehra shares her story: an account of life under Chinese rule in East Turkestan, and her journey to becoming a spokesperson against genocide. The grandchild of a musician and the daughter of an archaeologist, Gulchehra grew up with Uyghur culture and history running through her veins. She showed her gifts early on as a dancer, actress and storyteller, and she became a major television star.

The Dead of Winter (Hardback),Stuart MacBride,"It was supposed to be an easy job. All Detective Constable Edward Reekie had to do was pick up a dying prisoner from HMP Grampian and deliver him somewhere to live out his last few months in peace. From the outside, Glenfarach looks like a quaint, sleepy, snow-dusted village, nestled deep in the heart of Cairngorms National Park, but things aren't what they seem. The place is thick with security cameras and there's a strict nine o'clock curfew, because Glenfarach is the final sanctuary for people who've served their sentences but can't be safely released into the general population. Edward's new boss, DI Montgomery-Porter, insists they head back to Aberdeen before the approaching blizzards shut everything down, but when an ex-cop-turned-gangster is discovered tortured to death in his bungalow, someone needs to take charge. The weather's closing in, tensions are mounting, and time's running out - something nasty has come to Glenfarach, and Edward is standing right in its way...",2023-02-16,"['crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'thrillers']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-dead-of-winter/stuart-macbride/9781787634923,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7876/9781787634923.jpg

Two Sisters (Hardback),Blake Morrison,"Two Sisters publishes on the 30th anniversary of Blake Morrison's ground-breaking book And When Did You Last See Your Father? which forged the way for a new genre of confessional memoir. 'She's gone, that's all, and though there's no retrieving her I'd like to make sense of who she was and what she became. It wasn't just that she changed over time. She could change from day to day. Drink made it worse but the origins went deeper. You never knew which you'd get, the kind and loving Gill or her doppelganger. Two sisters.' Blake Morrison has lost a sister and a half-sister in recent years. Both are the subjects of this remarkable and heart-breaking memoir, along with a forensic examination of sibling relationships in history and literature. Blake's sister Gill struggled with alcoholism for a large part of her life, and her shocking death is the starting point for Two Sisters. Blake returns to their childhood to search for the origins of her later difficulties, and in doing so unearths the story behind his half-sister, Josie. As he unravels these narratives, Blake deals movingly in the guilt and shame that will be familiar to every person who has struggled with addiction in their family. He is unflinching in doing so, and the result is a book which provides testament to that common struggle, as well as acknowledging the complex, hidden forces on which all our lives are based. Two Sisters is the extraordinary new memoir from the chronicler of human frailty, Blake Morrison.",2023-02-16,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'prose:non-fiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/two-sisters/blake-morrison/9780008510527,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0085/9780008510527.jpg

It is one of the most fundamental aspects of the human condition  a part of our experience as a conscious being, no matter who we are. As time goes on, we all develop as people. None of us ever becomes someone else entirely – regardless of how we identify – but nor do we stay the same forever. We all transition. It's what binds us, not what separates us.

"Politics, Poverty and Belief: A Political Memoir (Hardback)",The Rt Hon Frank Field,"In this touching but also profound memoir, Field explains two key factors in his upbringing - the poverty of his own childhood and the deep and lasting effect of his Christian socialism, as exemplified in the writings of F. D. Maurice and William Temple. Field has spent his adult life fighting against poverty in Britain, through parliament and through his strong personal influence. Poverty for him has injustice at its root and as he explains in this book, he has found allies on all sides of the political spectrum. He was appointed by Tony Blair to be the Secretary of State for Pensions, but the reforms he advocated were so radical and essentially just, that Tony Blair could not contemplate them and Field stood down. Previously he had been Chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee under John Major. As we read in this profound book, he has been involved in the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) and worked with George Osborne to pass the legislation for the Minimum Living Wage. The range of his campaigns is astonishing. With the Rowntree Trust, he set up the Low Pay Unit (LPU), he battled with Chiswick Council to combat the corruption and injustice behind local housing lists. In politics, he spoke out in the House against the corruption of greed and power and for this he became greatly admired by Margaret Thatcher. In the end, Field's zeal for reform was too much for too many people. In 2015, Momentum (Trotskyite socialist political movement within the Labour Party) moved into his own local Labour party and managed to get him deselected. This is a political and personal memoir of quite exceptional importance and will be widely read, not least because it is an implicit indictment of modern British politics - the world of cash for questions, Partygate and all the rest - in which the poor get poorer and the rich get richer.",2023-02-16,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'historical', 'political', 'militarybiographies', 'historical', 'political', 'militaryautobiographies', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/politics-poverty-and-belief/the-rt-hon-frank-field/9781399408394,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/3994/9781399408394.jpg
Content Warning: Everything (Hardback),Akwaeke Emezi,"A fiercely contemporary collection which renegotiates the contract between poet and reader in the light of this moment in human history, from the bestselling author of The Death of Vivek Oji. Content Warning: Everything concerns itself with the fugitive nature of being in the world especially, but not exclusively, within blackness.

Between the Chalk and the Sea: A journey on foot into the past (Hardback),Gail Simmons,"RAYNOR WINN: 'I loved this memoir - centuries of stories captured in the chalk, all told through the prism of one life.'An old map.A lost pilgrimage route. A journey in search of our walking heritage.When Henry VIII banned pilgrimage in 1538, he ended not only a centuries-old tradition of walking as an act of faith, but a valuable chance to discover the joy of walking as an escape from the burdens of everyday life.Much was lost when these journeys faded from our collective memory, but clues to our past remain. On an antique map in Oxford's Bodleian Library, a faint red line threading through towns and villages between Southampton and Canterbury suggests a significant, though long-forgotten, road. Renamed the Old Way, medieval pilgrims are thought to have travelled this route to reach the celebrated shrine of Thomas Becket.Described as England's Camino, this long-distance footpath carves through one of the nation's most iconic landscapes - one that links prehistoric earthworks, abandoned monasteries, Saxon churches, ruined castles and historic seaports.Over four seasons, travel writer Gail Simmons walks the Old Way to rediscover what a long journey on foot offers us today. In the age of the car, what does it mean to embrace 'slow travel'? Why does being a woman walking alone still feel like a radical act? In an age when walking connects the nation, can we now reclaim pilgrimage as a secular act?Winding 240 miles between the chalk hills and shifting seascapes of the south coast, Gail ventures deep into our past, exploring this lost path and telling a story of kings and knights, peasants and pilgrims, of ancient folklore and modern politics. Blending history, anthropology, etymology and geology, Gail's walk along the Old Way reveals the rich natural and cultural heritage found on our own doorstep.",2023-02-16,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', 'travel', 'maps', 'activeoutdoorpursuits', 'walking', 'hiking', 'trekking']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/between-the-chalk-and-the-sea/gail-simmons/9781472280275,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4722/9781472280275.jpg
The Turning Tide: A Biography of the Irish Sea (Hardback),Jon Gower,"An immersive history of a pivotal stretch of water. The Turning Tide is a hymn to a sea passage of world-historical importance. Combining social and cultural history, nature-writing, travelogue and politics, Jon Gower charts a sea which has carried both Vikings and saints, invasion forces and furtive gun-runners, writers, musicians and fishermen. The divided but interconnected waters of the Irish Sea - from the narrow North Channel through St George's Channel to where the Celtic sea opens out into wide Atlantic - have a turbulent history to match the violence of its storms. Jon Gower is a sympathetic and interested pilot, taking the reader to the great shipyards of Belfast and through the mass exodus of the starving during the Irish Famine in coffin boats bound for America. He follows the migrations of working men and women looking for work in England and tells the tales of more casual travellers: sometimes seasick, often homesick too. The Irish Sea is also a place with an abundant natural history. The rarest sea bird in Europe visits its coasts in summer while the rarest goose wings in during winter. Jon Gower navigates waters teeming with life, filled with seals and salt-tanged stories and surveyed by seabirds. At a time when Irish affairs feel like they are building towards an historic crescendo, he tells the story of the people who have crossed these waters, and who live on their shores. Lyrically written and deeply considered, this is a remarkable and far-reaching book.",2023-02-16,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', '', 'history', 'general', 'worldhistory', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-turning-tide/jon-gower/9780008532635,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0085/9780008532635.jpg

GINA RIPPONThe idea that medicine is gender-neutral is a myth. This isn't inflammatory rhetoric; it's simply true. From the way pain is felt, to how heart attacks are diagnosed, to the very role society plays in the health of the body, the medical landscape in place today is one that was designed for, and by, men. This book is about all the ways medicine is not gender-neutral, from research to treatment to diagnosis. Throughout history, flawed mindsets have paved the way for sub-par treatment, and the prevailing attitudes that still exist today have had terrible repercussions for women and their bodies. Blending fascinating examples with historical and cultural context, and reflecting on her own personal experience with healthcare, Dr Marieke Bigg explores how women's bodies have been ignored, misunderstood and misdiagnosed, whilst keeping an eye to a better future.

Three years since they struck the spark they hoped would ignite the revolution. But the flame has failed to catch. The Krodans have crushed Ossia in an iron grip of terror. The revolution seems further away than ever. Far in the north, the Dawnwardens seek to unite the fractious clans of the Fell Folk and create a stronghold from which to retake their land. But even if they can overcome the danger of treachery from within, they still have to contend with the dreadknights. Only the druidess Vika can resist these near-unstoppable foes, and there's only one of her. But what if there was a weapon that could destroy the dreadknights?

Metamorphosis (Hardback),Robert Douglas-Fairhurst,"'We all have trapdoors in our lives. Sometimes we jump off just in time... but sometimes we are unlucky enough to be on the trapdoor when the lever is pulled. My own trapdoor was hidden in the consulting room of an Oxford neurologist.' When the trapdoor opened for Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, he plummeted into a world of MRI scans, a disobedient body and the crushing unpredictability of a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. But, like Alice tumbling into Wonderland, his fall did something else. It took him deep into his own mind: his hopes, his fears, his loves and losses, and the books that would sustain, inform and nourish him as his life began to transform in ways he could never have imagined. From Kafka to Barbellion, this is a literary map of the journey from the kingdom of the well to the land of the sick, and forwards into a hopeful future. It's an ode to great writing, to storytelling, to science and to the power of the imagination. And, above all, it's a darkly comic and moving reflection on what it means to be human in a world where nothing is certain.",2023-02-16,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'health', 'lifestyle', 'copingwithpersonalproblems', 'illness', 'specificconditions']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/metamorphosis/robert-douglas-fairhurst/9781787334250,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7873/9781787334250.jpg

Foolproof: Why We Fall for Misinformation and How to Build Immunity (Hardback),Sander van der Linden,"One of the world's top experts on fighting misinformation reveals the psychology behind its power - and how we can protect ourselves. From fake news to conspiracy theories, from pandemics to politics, misinformation may be the defining problem of our era. Like a virus, misinformation infects our minds - altering our beliefs and replicating at astonishing rates. Once the virus takes hold, our primary strategies of fact-checking and debunking are an insufficient cure. In Foolproof Sander van der Linden describes how to inoculate yourself and others against the spread of misinformation, discern fact from fiction and push back against methods of mass persuasion. Everyone is susceptible to fake news. There are polarising narratives in society, conspiracy theories are rife, fake experts dole out misleading advice and accuracy is often lost in favour of sensationalist headlines. So how and why does misinformation spread if we're all aware of its existence? And, more importantly, what can we do about it? Sander van der Linden takes us through the psychology of conspiratorial thinking and equips us with the eleven antigens needed to help stop the spread of misinformation once and for all.",2023-02-16,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'popularscience', 'popularmathematics', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'psychology', 'cognition', 'cognitivepsychology']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/foolproof/sander-van-der-linden/9780008466718,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0084/9780008466718.jpg

Through the project she was introduced to endless people and their dogs, and the distinct personalities and complex emotions that owners attribute to them. This was followed with Old Dogs, where Sally asked the public to send in photos of their elderly canines. She was drawn to the tales behind their greying whiskers and so the natural next step was rescue dogs with their eventful life stories. Rescue Dogs is a beautiful collection of loveable hounds with colourful histories and expressive faces.

Queen K (Hardback),Sarah Thomas,"On a balmy evening in late March, an oligarch's wife hosts a party on a superyacht moored in the Maldives. Tables cover the massive deck, adorned with orchids, champagne bottles, name cards of celebrities. Uniformed staff flank a red carpet on the landing dock. This is what Kata has wanted for a long time: acceptance into the glittering world of high society. But there are those who aim to come between Kata and her goal, and they are closer to home than she could have imagined. Witness to the corruption and violence underneath the shiny surfaces is Mel, a young English woman employed to tutor Kata's precocious daughter and navigate her through the class codes of English privilege. Now the closest Mel gets to such privilege is as hired help to the wealthy, and she is deeply resentful. Exquisitely written and deliciously unreliable, Queen K takes the reader to some of the most luxurious places in the world. But a dark refrain sounds from the very beginning of the story and grows towards its operatic finale: a novel about insatiable material desire can only ever be a tragedy.",2023-02-16,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', '', 'fiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/queen-k/sarah-thomas/9781800814905,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8008/9781800814905.jpg

From abortion rights to immigration, gun control to climate change, civil debate has gone out the window. Manners, order, and respect are being eroded. Why can't we all be reasonable?   The trouble is, what's 'reasonable' to one person is outrageous to another. Is it okay to let children play in the garden while others are working from home? To do your makeup on a train, or recline your seat on an aeroplane? What's the right way to breastfeed? To protect your neighbourhood? To protest against injustice and oppression? In a world where we all think we're being reasonable, how can we figure out what's right?   Looking back through history and around the world, Kirsty Sedgman set out to discover how unfairness and discrimination got baked into our social norms, dividing us along lines of gender, class, disability, sexuality, race... Instead of measuring human behaviour against outdated standards of rules and reason, On Being Unreasonable argues that sometimes we need to act unreasonably to bring about positive change.",2023-02-16,"['spirituality', 'beliefs', 'philosophy', 'social', 'politicalphilosophy', '', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'sociology', 'anthropology', 'sociology', 'socialtheory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/on-being-unreasonable/kirsty-sedgman/9780571366835,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/5713/9780571366835.jpg

Ugly: Giving us back our beauty standards (Hardback),Anita Bhagwandas,"We've all had those moments. The ones where you look in the mirror and nothing feels ok. For Anita Bhagwandas, this started when she was a child and it created an enduring internal torment about her looks. We're all told that this is just part of growing up, but it stays with us, evolving as we age. The internet tells us we should love ourselves, whilst bombarding us with images of airbrushed perfection, upholding centuries-old beauty standards which we can't always see. Our beauty rituals are so often based around things we think we need to fix, grow and develop - sometimes tipping into dangerous obsession. So, what seismic shift does it take to break free from this mentality? In Ugly, Anita uncovers where these beauty standards started, unpicks why they've been perpetuated and unmasks the structures that continue to support them. From the ever-growing cosmetic surgery industry, to the hidden pitfalls of 'pretty privilege', it is time to finally break free from those limiting beauty standards, because feeling ugly should have nothing to do with how we look, and everything to do with who wants us to feel lacking.",2023-02-16,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/ugly/anita-bhagwandas/9781788704755,https://cdn.waterstones.com/override/v1/large/9781/7887/9781788704755.jpg

Victory City (Hardback),Salman Rushdie,"The epic tale of a woman who breathes a fantastical empire into existence, only to be consumed by it over the centuries - from the transcendent imagination of Booker Prize-winning, internationally bestselling author Salman Rushdie. In the wake of an insignificant battle between two long-forgotten kingdoms in fourteenth-century southern India, a nine-year-old girl has a divine encounter that will change the course of history. After witnessing the death of her mother, the grief-stricken Pampa Kampana becomes a vessel for the goddess Parvati, who begins to speak out of the girl's mouth. Granting her powers beyond Pampa Kampana's comprehension, the goddess tells her that she will be instrumental in the rise of a great city called Bisnaga - literally 'victory city' - the wonder of the world. Over the next two hundred and fifty years, Pampa Kampana's life becomes deeply interwoven with Bisnaga's, from its literal sowing out of a bag of magic seeds to its tragic ruination in the most human of ways: the hubris of those in power. Whispering Bisnaga and its citizens into existence, Pampa Kampana attempts to make good on the task that Parvati set for her: to give women equal agency in a patriarchal world. But all stories have a way of getting away from their creator, and Bisnaga is no exception. As years pass, rulers come and go, battles are won and lost, and allegiances shift, the very fabric of Bisnaga becomes an ever more complex tapestry - with Pampa Kampana at its center. Brilliantly styled as a translation of an ancient epic, this is a saga of love, adventure, and myth that is in itself a testament to the power of storytelling.",2023-02-09,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/victory-city/salman-rushdie/9781787333444,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7873/9781787333444.jpg

Renowned naturalist and conservationist Nick Acheson spent countless hours observing and researching wild geese, transported through all weathers by his mother's 40-year-old trusty red bicycle. He meticulously details the geese's arrival, observing what they mean to his beloved Norfolk and the role they play in local people's lives - and what role the birds could play in our changing world. During a time when many people faced the prospect of little work or human contact, Nick followed the pinkfeet and brent geese that filled the Norfolk skies and landscape as they flew in from Iceland and Siberia. In their flocks, Nick encountered rarer geese, including Russian white-fronts, barnacle geese and an extremely unusual grey-bellied brant, a bird he had dreamt of seeing since thumbing his mother's copy of Peter Scott's field guide as a child. To honour the geese's great athletic migrations, Nick kept a diary of his sightings as well as the stories he discovered through the community of people, past and present, who loved them, too.

Tomorrow Perhaps the Future: Following Writers and Rebels in the Spanish Civil War (Hardback),Sarah Watling,"'Now, as certainly as never before, we are determined or compelled to take sides.' Nancy Cunard In the 1930s, women and men from across Britain, Europe and America made their way to Spain to be part of what they identified as a historic fight for freedom from fascism. Tomorrow Perhaps the Future follows a handful of extraordinary outsiders who were determined to live out their lives with courage and conviction.Sarah Watling weaves together the paths of the American journalists Martha Gellhorn and Josephine Herbst, the British writers and partners Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland, the aristocratic rebel Jessica Mitford, and the maverick poet Nancy Cunard, drawing in their responses to the Spanish Civil War in both literature and life. She considers the wary position of Virginia Woolf, trying and failing to keep the conflict out of her family, and searches out the stories of African-American nurse Salaria Kea, Jewish photographer Gerda Taro and others, tracing their decisions to face up to history. For each woman, Spain became a defining episode of her life, where many of them found a freedom unthinkable at home.A year into the struggle, Nancy Cunard took an urgent poll of contemporary writers asking the question straight: which side are you on? In our age of political divisions and war, Tomorrow Perhaps the Future is a book that asks questions of solidarity, resistance and the arts, which explores how we respond to the need to declare a side, and how we know when that moment - the moment to step forward - has arrived.",2023-02-09,"['biography', 'truestories', 'generalbiography']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/tomorrow-perhaps-the-future/sarah-watling/9781787332409,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7873/9781787332409.jpg

Art & Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking (Hardback),David Bayles,"Art & Fear is about the way art gets made, the reasons it often doesn't get made, and the nature of the difficulties that cause so many artists to give up along the way.

"Stone Will Answer: A Journey Guided by Craft, Myth and Geology (Hardback)",Beatrice Searle,"A beautiful memoir, travelogue, and meditation on stone by artist and stone mason Beatrice Searle. 'What are you doing? If you don't mind me asking?' I say that we are taking this stone to Trondheim. I continue to tell her the story of Magnus and ancient Kings. 'Would you like to stand in it?' I ask. 'That is what it is for.' At the age of twenty-six, Beatrice Searle crossed the North sea and walked 500 miles through Southern Norway on a medieval pilgrim path to Nidaros Cathedral, taking with her a 40-kilo stone from the West coast of Orkney. She had recently completed her masonry training at Lincoln Cathedral and become fascinated with the mysterious footprint stones of Scandinavia, Northern Europe and the ancient Greco-Roman world; stones closely associated with travellers, saints and the inauguration of Kings. Following in their footsteps, her stone becomes a talisman of sorts, a bedrock on the move, and an offering to those she meets along the way. Stone Will Answer is an unusual adventure story of resilience and homecoming, of weight and motion, of rediscovering love and faith, and of journeys practical, spiritual and geological. A captivating blend of exploration, memoir and myth, and an insight into a beguiling craft, it asks what lessons might be learned from stone, what we choose to carry with us and what we return to put down or pick up again.",2023-02-09,"['poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'prose:non-fiction', '', 'art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'art', 'designstyles/historyofart', 'arts', 'craftsstyle', 'biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/stone-will-answer/beatrice-searle/9781787302556,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7873/9781787302556.jpg

Today the city is an international destination for culture and sport, and one of the fastest-growing urban regions in Europe. This book offers a first-hand account of what happened in between.

Colonialism: A Moral Reckoning (Hardback),Nigel Biggar,"In the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet empire in 1989, many believed that we had arrived at the 'End of History' - that the global dominance of liberal democracy had been secured forever. Now however, with Russia rattling its sabre on the borders of Europe and China rising to challenge the post-1945 world order, the liberal West faces major threats. These threats are not only external. Especially in the Anglosphere, the 'decolonisation' movement corrodes the West's self-confidence by retelling the history of European and American colonial dominance as a litany of racism, exploitation, and massively murderous violence. Nigel Biggar tests this indictment, addressing the crucial questions in eight chapters: Was the British Empire driven primarily by greed and the lust to dominate? Should we speak of 'colonialism and slavery' in the same breath, as if they were identical? Was the Empire essentially racist? How far was it based on the theft of land? Did it involve genocide? Was it driven fundamentally by the motive of economic exploitation? Was undemocratic colonial government necessarily illegitimate? and, Was the Empire essentially violent, and its violence pervasively racist and terroristic? Biggar makes clear that, like any other long-standing state, the British Empire involved elements of injustice, sometimes appalling. On occasions it was culpably incompetent and presided over moments of dreadful tragedy. Nevertheless, from the early 1800s the Empire was committed to abolishing the slave trade in the name of a Christian conviction of the basic equality of all human beings. It ended endemic inter-tribal warfare, opened local economies to the opportunities of global trade, moderated the impact of inescapable modernisation, established the rule of law and liberal institutions such as a free press, and spent itself in defeating the murderously racist Nazi and Japanese empires in the Second World War. As encyclopaedic in historical breadth as it is penetrating in analytical depth, Colonialism offers a moral inquest into the colonial past, forensically contesting damaging falsehoods and thereby helping to rejuvenate faith in the West's future.",2023-02-02,"['history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'colonialism', 'imperialism', '', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'europe', 'history', 'militaryhistory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/colonialism/nigel-biggar/9780008511630,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0085/9780008511630.jpg

Finding Hildasay (Hardback),Christian Lewis,"'Now I was finally out of the force of the wind, my body began to warm - the part where the real pain sets in. I'd felt it plenty of times before on this journey, but this time it was different. As I began to regain feeling in my fingers and toes, it burned so strongly that I just sat in tears of pain.' Christian Lewis had hit rock bottom, suffering with depression so severe he would shut himself in his bedroom for weeks. Then, in August 2017, while surfing - his only respite - he cast his eyes along the coastline and realised it was the only place he really wanted to be. Making an impulsive decision to set himself a challenge - walk the entire coastline of the UK - he gave himself a few days to rustle up a tent and walking boots, then left for good with just a tenner in his pocket and two days' worth of food. Little did he know at the time just how long it would take to cross the finish line - and the encounters that lay ahead that would turn his life around. Five years later, he has navigated the West Coast, Northern Ireland, the hard-rock cliffs of Scotland and the perimeters of the Scottish Islands - where he spent three months on an uninhabited island called Hildasay, where there was no fresh water or food. It was there, the most barren his route had become, that the more pride and respect he found within himself - and the more remarkable his journey became. Happiness and hope was just around the corner. With a foreword from long-time supporter Ben Fogle, Finding Hildasay is a brutal and beautiful true story of depression, survival and the meaning of home.",2023-02-02,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'truestories', 'truestoriesofheroism', 'endurance', 'survival', 'travel', 'maps', 'travelwriting']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/finding-hildasay/christian-lewis/9781035006793,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/0350/9781035006793.jpg

The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism (Hardback),Martin Wolf,"From the author of The Shifts and the Shocks, and one of the most influential writers on economics, a reckoning with how and why the relationship between democracy and capitalism is coming undone We are living in an age when economic failings have shaken faith in global capitalism. Political failings have undermined trust in liberal democracy and in the very notion of truth. The ties that ought to bind open markets to free and fair elections are being strained and rejected, even in democracy's notional heartlands. Around the world, democratic capitalism, which depends on the determined separation of power from wealth, is in crisis. Some now argue that capitalism is better without democracy; others that democracy is better without capitalism.This book is a forceful rejoinder to both views. It analyses how the marriage between capitalism and democracy has become so fraught and yet insists that a divorce would be an almost unimaginable calamity. Martin Wolf, one of the wisest public voices on global affairs, argues that for all its recent failings - slowing growth, increasing inequality, widespread popular disillusion - democratic capitalism, though inherently fragile, remains the best system we know for human flourishing. Capitalism and democracy are complementary opposites: they need each other if either is to thrive. Wolf's superb exploration of their marriage shows us how citizenship and a shared faith in the common good are not romantic slogans but the essential foundation of our economic and political freedom.",2023-02-02,"['business', 'finance', 'law', 'economics', 'politicaleconomy', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', 'politicalstructure', 'processes', 'democracy', 'business', 'finance', 'law', 'economics', 'populareconomics']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-crisis-of-democratic-capitalism/martin-wolf/9780241303412,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2413/9780241303412.jpg

It is said that the lead actress Lilith has made a pact with Melpomene, the tragic muse of Greek mythology, to become the greatest actress to ever grace the stage. Suspicious of Lilith, the jealous wife of the theatre owner sends dresser Jenny to spy on her, and desperate for the money to help her family, Jenny agrees. What Jenny finds is a woman as astonishing in her performance as she is provocative in nature. On stage, it's as though Lilith is possessed by the characters she plays, yet off stage she is as tragic as the Muse who inspires her, and Jenny, sorry for her, befriends the troubled actress. But when strange events begin to take place around the theatre, Jenny wonders if the rumours are true, and fears that when the Muse comes calling for payment, the cost will be too high.",2023-02-02,"['fiction', 'historicalfiction', '', 'fiction', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'crime', 'mystery']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-whispering-muse/laura-purcell/9781526627186,https://cdn.waterstones.com/override/v1/large/9781/5266/9781526627186.jpg

In Ascension (Hardback),Martin MacInnes,"Leigh grew up in Rotterdam, drawn to the waterfront as an escape from her unhappy home life and volatile father. Enchanted by the undersea world of her childhood, she excels in marine biology, travelling the globe to study ancient organisms. When a trench is discovered in the Atlantic ocean, Leigh joins the exploration team, hoping to find evidence of the earth's first life forms - what she instead finds calls into question everything we know about our own beginnings. Her discovery leads Leigh to the Mojave desert and an ambitious new space agency. Drawn deeper into the agency's work, she learns that the Atlantic trench is only one of several related phenomena from across the world, each piece linking up to suggest a pattern beyond human understanding. Leigh knows that to continue working with the agency will mean leaving behind her declining mother and her younger sister, and faces an impossible choice: to remain with her family, or to embark on a journey across the breadth of the cosmos. Exploring the natural world with the wonder and reverence we usually reserve for the stars, In Ascension is a compassionate, deeply inquisitive epic that reaches outward to confront the greatest questions of existence, looks inward to illuminate the smallest details of the human heart, and shows how - no matter how far away we might be and how much we have lost hope - we will always attempt to return to the people and places we call home.",2023-02-02,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', '', 'sciencefiction', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'sciencefiction', 'sciencefiction', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'fantasy']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/in-ascension/martin-macinnes/9781838956240,https://cdn.waterstones.com/override/v2/large/9781/8389/9781838956240.jpg

The Blazing World: A New History of Revolutionary England (Hardback),Dr Jonathan Healey,"A major new history of England's turbulent seventeenth century and how it marked the birth of a new world. The seventeenth century began as the English suddenly found themselves ruled by a Scotsman, and ended in the shadow of an invasion by the Dutch. Under James I, the country suffered terrorism and witch panics. Under his son Charles, state and society collapsed into civil war, to be followed by an army coup and regicide. For a short time - for the only time in history - England was a republic. There were bitter struggles over faith and no boundaries to politics. In the coffee shops and alehouses of plague-ridden London, new ideas were forged that were angry, populist and almost impossible for monarchs to control. Despite the radical changes that transformed England, few today understand the story of this revolutionary age. Leaders like Oliver Cromwell, Charles II, and William of Orange have been reduced to caricatures, while major turning points like the Civil War and the Glorious Revolution have become shrouded in myth and misunderstanding. Yet the seventeenth century has never been more relevant. The British constitution is once again being contested, and we face a culture war reminiscent of when the Roundheads fought the Cavaliers. From raw politics to religious divisions, civil wars to witch trials, plague to press freedoms, The Blazing World is the story of a strange but fascinating century, told in sparkling detail. Drawing on vast archives, Jonathan Healey refreshes our understanding of public figures while simultaneously taking us into the lives of ordinary people to illuminate a revolutionary society that forged a new world.",2023-02-02,"['history', 'general', 'worldhistory', '', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'britain', 'ireland']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-blazing-world/dr-jonathan-healey/9781526621658,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5266/9781526621658.jpg
"Red Memory: Living, Remembering and Forgetting China's Cultural Revolution (Hardback)",Tania Branigan,"An indelible exploration of the Cultural Revolution and how it shapes China today, Red Memory uncovers forty years of silence through the rarely heard stories of individuals who lived through Mao's decade of madness. A 13-year-old Red Guard revels in the great adventure, and struggles with her doubts. A silenced composer, facing death, determines to capture the turmoil. An idealistic student becomes the 'corpse master' . . . More than fifty years after the turmoil began, the Cultural Revolution's scar runs through the heart of Chinese society, and through the souls of its citizens. Stationed in Beijing for the Guardian, Tania Branigan came to realise that this brutal and turbulent decade continues to propel and shape China to this day. Yet official suppression and personal trauma have conspired in national amnesia: it exists, for the most part, as an absence. Red Memory explores the stories of those who are driven to confront the era, fearing or yearning its return. What happens to a society when you can no longer trust those closest to you? What happens to the present when the past is buried, exploited or redrawn?

Gennaro's Cucina: Hearty Money-Saving Meals from an Italian Kitchen (Hardback),Gennaro Contaldo,"In an era of excessive convenience and disposable food waste, Gennaro's Cucina could not come at a better time - you will learn how to use simple ingredients in inventive ways, eat seasonally, spend less and ultimately eat better. 'Cucina povera' is the food that traditionally fed the poor of Italy yet remains the basis of most Italian dishes we love to eat today. It's a simple philosophy - delicious, hearty meals using accessible and affordable ingredients. Encouraging an ethos of zero waste, Gennaro's Cucina ensures that every part of the ingredient, and your budget, is put to good culinary use. Along with the majority of post-war Italian families, a young Gennaro was raised on a diet harvested on a limited budget. Restricted choice of scarce ingredients meant they learnt the value what they had, how to cook dishes lovingly and use imaginative methods of preservation to make simple dishes go far: including salting, drying and curing. In this inspirational cookbook, Gennaro takes you on a culinary journey of regional basic Italian staples and turns them into beautiful meals. With tips and ideas of what to do with leftovers, Gennaro helps home cooks squeeze maximum use from the 'cucina povera' ethos, turning humble ingredients into nourishing feasts without taste sacrifice.

These Infinite Threads - This Woven Kingdom (Hardback),Tahereh Mafi,"Full of explosive magic, searing romance, and heartbreaking betrayal, These Infinite Threads is the breathtaking sequel to the instant New York Times and Sunday Times bestseller This Woven Kingdom. With the heat of a kiss, the walls between Alizeh, the long-lost heir to an ancient Jinn kingdom, and Kamran, the crown prince of the Ardunian empire, have crumbled. And so have both of their lives. Kamran's grandfather, the king of Ardunia, lays dead, the terrible secret of his deal with the devil exposed to the world. Cyrus, the mysterious copper-haired royal, has stolen Alizeh away to Tulan, the neighboring kingdom where he rules. Cyrus has made his own deal with the devil-one that would require Alizeh to betray her feelings for Kamran if she's to reclaim the Jinn throne. Alizeh wants nothing to do with Cyrus, or his deal with Iblees. But with no means of escaping Tulan, and with the tantalizing promise of fulfilling her destiny as the heir to the Jinn, she's forced to wonder whether she can set aside her emotions-and finally become the queen her people need. Kamran, meanwhile, is picking up the pieces of his broken kingdom. Facing betrayal at every turn, all he knows for certain is that he must go to Tulan to avenge his grandfather. He can only hope that Alizeh will be waiting for him there-and that she's not yet become queen of Tulan.",2023-02-02,"[""children's"", 'teenage', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'fantasyromance', '', ""children's"", 'teenage', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'crime', 'thrillers', ""children's"", 'teenage', 'fiction', 'family', 'home']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/these-infinite-threads/tahereh-mafi/9780755500116,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/7555/9780755500116.jpg

Finding Hildasay: Signed Edition (Hardback),Christian Lewis,"'Now I was finally out of the force of the wind, my body began to warm - the part where the real pain sets in. I'd felt it plenty of times before on this journey, but this time it was different. As I began to regain feeling in my fingers and toes, it burned so strongly that I just sat in tears of pain.' Christian Lewis had hit rock bottom, suffering with depression so severe he would shut himself in his bedroom for weeks. Then, in August 2017, while surfing - his only respite - he cast his eyes along the coastline and realised it was the only place he really wanted to be. Making an impulsive decision to set himself a challenge - walk the entire coastline of the UK - he gave himself a few days to rustle up a tent and walking boots, then left for good with just a tenner in his pocket and two days' worth of food. Little did he know at the time just how long it would take to cross the finish line - and the encounters that lay ahead that would turn his life around. Five years later, he has navigated the West Coast, Northern Ireland, the hard-rock cliffs of Scotland and the perimeters of the Scottish Islands - where he spent three months on an uninhabited island called Hildasay, where there was no fresh water or food. It was there, the most barren his route had become, that the more pride and respect he found within himself - and the more remarkable his journey became. Happiness and hope was just around the corner. With a foreword from long-time supporter Ben Fogle, Finding Hildasay is a brutal and beautiful true story of depression, survival and the meaning of home.",2023-02-02,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/finding-hildasay/christian-lewis/2928377164201,https://cdn.waterstones.com/override/v1/large/2928/3771/2928377164201.jpg
The North Will Rise Again: In Search of the Future in Northern Heartlands (Hardback),Alex Niven,"An in-depth exploration of the importance of the North of England in the modern era. The North Will Rise Again covers the colourful adventures of its inhabitants, the expansiveness and optimism that defines Northern culture, and the recurrent sense of failure and despair that is at the heart of one of the West's most impoverished regions. By telling the story of the North in the last few decades, Alex goes in search of answers to some of the big questions at the forefront of British politics and society today, touching on live issues including the North/South divide, austerity, the impact of Brexit, the collapse of Labour's 'Red Wall', and calls for regional devolution. He concludes with a powerful argument for a revival of northern politics and society by way of what he calls 'radical regionalism'. A native Northerner himself, having returned to his home city of Newcastle with his family in the last few years, Alex also includes elements of memoir and stories from his own family history to reflect some of the key arguments of his book. To what extent are the crises of the last ten years partly the result of fundamental divides and inequalities in the geography of England? How did the North become a place of lost potential and broken dreams? And what can be done to make it one of the most dynamic and forward-looking places in the world once again? Niven considers all these questions and more in this lively and highly topical book.",2023-02-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', '', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'sociology', 'anthropology', 'sociology', 'work', 'labour']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-north-will-rise-again/alex-niven/9781472993465,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4729/9781472993465.jpg

"Architects of Terror: Paranoia, Conspiracy and Anti-Semitism in Franco's Spain (Hardback)",Paul Preston,"From the preeminent historian of 20th century Spain Paul Preston, Architects of Terror is a new history of how paranoia, conspiracy and anti-Semitism was used to justify the military coup of 1936 and enabled the construction of a dictatorship built on violence and persecution. It is the previously untold story of how antisemitic beliefs were weaponised to justify and propagate the Franco overthrow of liberal Spain. The Spanish military coup of 1936 was launched to overturn the social and economic reforms of the democratic Second Republic, and its educational and cultural challenges to the established order. The consequent civil war was fought in the interests of the landowners, industrialists, bankers, clerics and army officers whose privileges were threatened. However, a central justification for a war that took the lives of around 500,000 Spaniards was that it was being fought to combat an alleged scheme for world domination by a non-existent 'Jewish- Masonic-Bolshevik Conspiracy'. Despite the fact that Spain had only a tiny minority of Jews and Freemasons, Franco and his inner circle were ardent believers in this fabricated conspiracy and spread the notion that the survival of Catholic Spain, as well, of course, of the establishment ' s economic interests, required the total annihilation of Jews and Freemasons. Architects of Terror is the story of how fake news, mendacity, corruption and nostalgia for lost empire generated violence and hatred. The book presents vivid portraits of the key ideologues who propagated the myth of the Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik Conspiracy and of the military figures who implemented the atrocities that it justified. Among the convictions shared by these individuals was their belief in the idea that Freemasonry was responsible for Spain ' s loss of empire and in the factual veracity of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the notorious fiction about the global domination of the Jews. This is a history that reverberates in our own political moment.",2023-02-02,"['history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'europe', '', 'history', 'historicalperiods', 'postwar20thcenturyhistory:1945to2000', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'post-colonialism']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/architects-of-terror/paul-preston/9780008522117,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0085/9780008522117.jpg
These Infinite Threads: Signed Bookplate Edition (Hardback),Tahereh Mafi,"Full of explosive magic, searing romance, and heartbreaking betrayal, These Infinite Threads is the breathtaking sequel to the instant New York Times and Sunday Times bestseller This Woven Kingdom.

Kamran's grandfather, the king of Ardunia, lays dead, the terrible secret of his deal with the devil exposed to the world. Cyrus, the mysterious copper-haired royal, has stolen Alizeh away to Tulan, the neighboring kingdom where he rules.

Alizeh wants nothing to do with Cyrus, or his deal with Iblees. But with no means of escaping Tulan, and with the tantalizing promise of fulfilling her destiny as the heir to the Jinn, she's forced to wonder whether she can set aside her emotions-and finally become the queen her people need. Kamran, meanwhile, is picking up the pieces of his broken kingdom. Facing betrayal at every turn, all he knows for certain is that he must go to Tulan to avenge his grandfather.

For most of our existence , we were all nomads, and some of us still are. Houses and permanent settlements are a relatively late development - dating back little more than twelve thousand years. Borders and passports are much more recent. From the Neanderthals, Alexander the Great, Christopher Columbus and Pocahontas to the African slave trade, Fu Manchu, and Barack Obama, Migrants shows us that it is only by understanding how migration and migrants have been viewed in the past, that we can re-set the terms of the modern-day debate about migration.Migrants presents us with an alternative history of the world, in which migration is restored to the heart of the human story. And in which humans migrate for a wide range of reasons: not just because of civil war, or poverty or climate change but also out of curiosity and a sense of adventure. On arrival, migrants are expected both to assimilate and encouraged to remain distinctive; to defend their heritage and adopt a new one. They are sub-human and super-human; romanticised and castigated, admired and abhorred.

In We Are Electric we cross the next frontier of scientific understanding: discover your body's electrome.Every cell in our bodies - bones, skin, nerves, muscle - has a voltage, like a tiny battery. This bioelectricity is why our brains can send signals to our bodies, why we develop the way we do in the womb and how our bodies know to heal themselves from injury. When bioelectricity goes awry, illness, deformity and cancer can result. But if we can control or correct this bioelectricity, the implications for our health are remarkable: an undo switch for cancer that could flip malignant cells back into healthy ones; the ability to regenerate cells, organs, even limbs; to slow ageing and so much more.In We Are Electric, award-winning science writer Sally Adee explores the history of bioelectricity: from Galvani's epic eighteenth-century battle with the inventor of the battery, Alessandro Volta, to the medical charlatans claiming to use electricity to cure pretty much anything, to advances in the field helped along by the unusually massive axons of squid.

At once heartfelt and hilarious, Fling by Joseph Murray is the story of a fateful - and faithful - affair to remind us all that sometimes, what you're looking for might just be closer than you think.",2023-02-02,"['romanticfiction', 'contemporaryromance']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/fling/joseph-murray/9781529098662,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5290/9781529098662.jpg
"The Other Side: A Journey into Women, Art and the Spirit World (Hardback)",Jennifer Higgie,"It's not so long ago that a woman's expressed interest in other realms would have ruined her reputation, or even killed her. And yet spiritualism, in various incarnations, has influenced numerous men - including lauded modernist artists such as Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Kazimir Malevich and Paul Klee - without repercussion. The fact that so many radical women artists of their generation - and earlier - also drank deeply from the same spiritual well has for too long been sorely neglected. In The Other Side, we explore the lives and work of a group of extraordinary women, from the twelfth-century mystic, composer and artist Hildegard of Bingen to the nineteenth-century English spiritualist Georgiana Houghton, whose paintings swirl like a cosmic Jackson Pollock; the early twentieth-century Swedish artist, Hilma af Klint, who painted with the help of her spirit guides and whose recent exhibition at New York's Guggenheim broke all attendance records; the 'Desert Transcendentalist', Agnes Pelton, who painted her visions beneath the vast skies of California; the Swiss healer, Emma Kunz, who used geometric drawings to treat her patients; and the British surrealist and occultist, Ithell Colquhoun, whose estate of more than 5,000 works recently entered the Tate gallery collection. While the individual work of these artists is unique, the women loosely shared the same goal: to communicate with, and learn from, other dimensions. Weaving in and out of these myriad lives, sharing her own memories of otherworldly experiences, Jennifer Higgie discusses the solace of ritual, the gender exclusions of art history, the contemporary relevance of myth, the boom in alternative ways of understanding the world and the impact of spiritualism on feminism and contemporary art. A radical reappraisal of a marginalised group of artists, The Other Side is an intoxicating blend of memoir, biography and art history.",2023-02-02,"['art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'art', 'designstyles/historyofart', '', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'religion', 'aspectsofreligion', 'spirituality', 'religiousexperience', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'feminism', 'feministtheory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-other-side/jennifer-higgie/9781474623322,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4746/9781474623322.jpg

"Tiny Traumas: When You Don't Know What's Wrong, but Nothing Feels Quite Right (Hardback)",Dr Meg Arroll,"'How are you really feeling? A bit blah, meh or simply 'I don't actually know'. If this is your honest, knot-in-the-throat response, take a moment - breathe - and let me reassure you that it's not you, it's what's happened to you over the years. You can't quite put your finger on it, but somehow you just don't feel like you're thriving or truly participating in your own life. This is the result of a build-up of life's scrapes, papercuts and bruises that have left you feeling simply 'not ok'. Emotional illiteracy, microaggressions, challenging familial relationships, toxic positivity and gaslighting are some examples of what I call 'Tiny T' trauma - the impact of which often leads to problems such as high-functioning anxiety, languishing, perfectionism, comfort eating and sleep disturbance, to name but a few. We have been fooled into believing that 'Tiny T' trauma doesn't matter. There always seem to be huge, intractable problems in the world, so we tend to overlook those small, everyday injuries that drill down to your core. This leaves us with an undercurrent of constant melancholy and niggling pinpricks of anxiety, all wrapped up in the film of other people's Insta-perfect lives. But life doesn't have to be experienced in this suffocating way; we owe it to ourselves to develop Awareness, Acceptance, and take Action on our Tiny T trauma, no matter how 'small', and to start living every day as we deserve.'",2023-02-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'psychology', 'psychologyofemotions', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'sociology', 'anthropology', 'anthropology', 'social', 'culturalanthropology', 'ethnography', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'psychology', 'psychologicaltheory', 'schoolsofthought']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/tiny-traumas/dr-meg-arroll/9780008536404,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0085/9780008536404.jpg

How Many More Women?: The silencing of women by the law and how to stop it (Hardback),Jennifer Robinson,"We are in a crucial moment: women are breaking through the cultural reticence around gender-based violence. But just as survivors have begun to feel empowered to speak out, a new form of systematic silencing has made itself more evident: rich and powerful men are using teams of lawyers to suppress allegations and prevent newspaper stories from running. Individual women, advocacy groups and journalists find themselves fighting against censorship. The law is being wielded to reinforce the status quo of silence that existed before #MeToo. If women cannot speak about their abuse - and journalists are fearful of telling their stories - then how can we understand the problem of gender-based violence in our society? And how can we even begin to end it? In How Many More Women? internationally-acclaimed human rights lawyers, Jennifer Robinson and Keina Yoshida, examine the broken systems and explore the changes needed in order to ensure that women's freedom, including their freedom of speech, is no longer threatened by the laws that are supposed to protect them.",2023-02-02,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialgroups', 'genderstudies', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'feminism', 'feministtheory', 'business', 'finance', 'law', 'law', 'jurisprudence', 'generalissues', 'gender', 'thelaw']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/how-many-more-women/jennifer-robinson/keina-yoshida/9781804190203,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8041/9781804190203.jpg

"River of the Gods: Genius, Courage, and Betrayal in the Search for the Source of the Nile (Hardback)",Candice Millard,"A story of courage and adventure, set against the backdrop of the race to exploit Africa by the colonial powers. For millennia the location of the Nile River's headwaters was shrouded in mystery. In the mid-19th century, Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke were sent by the Royal Geographical Society to claim the prize for Britain. Burton spoke twenty-nine languages, and was a decorated soldier. He was also mercurial, subtle, and an iconoclastic atheist. Speke was a young aristocrat and Army officer determined to make his mark, Burton's opposite in temperament and beliefs. From the start the two men clashed. They would endure tremendous hardship, illness, and constant setbacks. Two years in, deep in the African interior, Burton became too sick to press on, but Speke did, and claimed he found the source in a great lake that he christened Lake Victoria. When they returned to England, the two became sworn enemies. Yet there was a third man on both expeditions, his name obscured by imperial annals, whose exploits were even more extraordinary. This was Sidi Mubarak Bombay, who was enslaved and shipped from his home village in East Africa to India. When the man who purchased him died, he made his way into the local Sultan's army, and eventually travelled back to Africa, where he used his resourcefulness, linguistic prowess and raw courage to forge a living as a guide. Without Bombay and men like him, who led, carried, and protected the expedition, neither Englishman would have come close to the headwaters of the Nile, or perhaps even survived.",2023-02-02,"['history', 'general', 'worldhistory', '', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'earthsciences', 'geography', 'environment', 'planning', 'geography', 'geographicaldiscovery', 'exploration']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/river-of-the-gods/candice-millard/9781800752610,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8007/9781800752610.jpg

Us and Them: The Authorised Story of Hipgnosis (Hardback),Mark Blake,"Between the late '60s and early '80s, design house Hipgnosis created some of the most iconic and ubiquitous album artwork of all time. Their original lifespan coincided with the golden age of the 12-inch LP, beginning just as the Beatles' Sgt Pepper made the record sleeve the ultimate blank canvas and ending just as new technology looked set to usurp vinyl.  Having originally been approached to design an album cover for their friends Pink Floyd, students Aubrey 'Po' Powell and Storm Thorgerson would go on to define the visual identity of rock and roll for the next fifteen years, swiftly gaining international prominence for their famed The Dark Side of the Moon artwork. This paved the way for other major musicians to set foot in the surreal photo-design world of Storm and Po, resulting in seminal Hipgnosis creations for the likes of Led Zeppelin, Paul McCartney, Genesis, Black Sabbath, ELO and Yes.  In this authorised account, with access to previously unpublished material and exclusive contributions from David Gilmour, Jimmy Page, Peter Gabriel, Roger Waters, Robert Plant and even Aubrey Powell himself, Mark Blake goes behind the scenes of the Hipgnosis partnership to reveal the pioneering ambition and grand vision that led to their success, as well as the clashing egos and artistic differences that undermined it. The Hipgnosis story also offers hitherto-untold insight into some of music's most legendary bands, as viewed through the prism of the people who shaped their imagery and cultural legacy.  With the work of Hipgnosis continuing to be referenced, reproduced and revered worldwide, Us and Them serves as a celebration, a cautionary tale and a compelling human drama, exploring the vital intersection between art and music.",2023-02-02,"['art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'art', 'designstyles/historyofart', 'conceptualart', '', 'art', 'fashion', 'photography', 'art', 'design', 'industrial/commercialart', 'design', 'graphicdesign', 'entertainment', 'music', 'musicalstyles', 'genres', 'rock', 'pop']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/us-and-them/mark-blake/9781788705677,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7887/9781788705677.jpg

It took years, and a bitter struggle with alcohol addiction, to unpick the intricate traumas of her past and present. Candid yet lyrical, In Ordinary Time mines the ways that trauma reverberates through time and through individual lives, drawing connections to the events and rhythms of Ireland's long Celtic, early Christian and Catholic history. From tragically lost siblings to the broader social scars of the Famine and the Magdalene Laundries, Mc Mahon sketches the evolution of a consciousness from her conservative 1970s upbringing to 1990s New York, and back to the much-changed Ireland of today.",2023-02-02,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'generalbiography', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'religion', 'christianity', 'churches', 'denominations']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/in-ordinary-time/carmel-mc-mahon/9780715654477,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/7156/9780715654477.jpg

The Treasuries: Poetry Anthologies and the Making of British Culture (Hardback),Clare Bucknell,"The fascinating history of poetry anthologies and their influence on British society and culture over the last four centuries. For hundreds of years, readers have encountered literature for the first time through anthologies of poetry. In the eighteenth century, young ladies were introduced to the 'safe' bits of Shakespeare or Milton through censored collections; Victorian working-class men and women enrolled at adult learning colleges to be taught from The Golden Treasury; soldiers nursed copies of The Oxford Book of English Verse in the trenches of World War One; pop-loving teenagers growing up in Liverpool in the 1960s got their first taste of the counterculture from the bestselling The Mersey Sound. But anthologies aren't just part of literary history. Over the centuries, they have shaped British society and culture, creating new reading publics and generating conversations around politics, national identity, morality, class, gender and sex. The Treasuries, by the literary scholar and journalist Clare Bucknell, is the story of the poetry anthology in English: an accessible social history that explores the impact of a handful of widely read books across four centuries. Ranging from the seventeenth-century Poems on Affairs of State series, which opened up the salacious world of King Charles II's court to gossip-hungry outsiders, to twenty-first-century collections which turn to poetry as a form of life-affirming therapy, The Treasuries reveals the extraordinary amount we can learn about our history by looking back at the anthologies that brought readers together and changed the way they thought.",2023-02-02,"['poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'literature:history', 'criticism', 'poetry', 'poets', '', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'britain', 'ireland', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-treasuries/clare-bucknell/9781800241442,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8002/9781800241442.jpg
Disease X: The 100 Days Mission to End Pandemics (Hardback),Kate Kelland,"With a foreword written by former British Prime Minister, Sir Tony Blair, DISEASE X is a must-read, fast-paced, almost-real-time account of how international scientists and global public health leaders are preparing the world to be able to contain outbreaks of new and re-emerging infectious diseases before they spawn deadly global contagions like Covid-19. DISEASE X is the codename given by the World Health Organisation to a pathogen currently unknown to science that could cause havoc to humankind. Emerging infections are sending us multiple warnings that another Disease X is looming. We've had SARS in 2002, H5N1 bird flu in 2004, H1N1 'swine flu' in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2015 and now COVID-19. These events are not freak events, but are happening continually, and at an increasing cadence. Written by a long-standing ex-Reuters global health and science correspondent, Kate Kelland, DISEASE X uses privileged access to the body leading international efforts to control viral outbreaks, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and its CEO, Dr Richard Hatchett. CEPI seed-funded three successful COVID vaccines, including the AstraZeneca and Moderna shots. Weaving in insights from the likes of Bill Gates, Erna Solberg, Jeremy Farrar and Seth Berkley, DISEASE X explores the the emergence of the novel coronavirus and the deadly crisis it caused. It analyses the responses of global health organisations and experts, including the WHO; national governments in Britain, China and the USA; COVAX, the global vaccine allocation facility; pharmaceutical companies; and leading research scientists. Ultimately, DISEASE X is a story of hope. It tells of how, throughout the devastation of Covid, science and human ingenuity have shown that the world can devise intricate new weapons at breath-taking pace against deadly diseases it has never encountered before. It also tells how the world's public health scientists are embarking on a 100 Days Mission to embed that scientific progress into a pandemic-busting plan to defuse future threats from as-yet-unknown pathogens in a little over three months. This is the 100 Days Mission - backed by the G7 and G20 - that will see a newly prepared world, one that can move at speed to snuff out future threats before they become deadly pandemics.",2023-02-02,"['science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'medicine', 'medicine:generalissues', 'publichealth', 'preventivemedicine', '', 'biography', 'truestories', 'truestories', 'truestoriesofdiscovery', 'history', 'science', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'medicine', 'clinical', 'internalmedicine', 'diseases', 'disorders']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/disease-x/kate-kelland/tony-blair/9781912454952,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/9124/9781912454952.jpg
The Mountain in the Sea (Hardback),Ray Nayler,"There are creatures in the water of Con Dao. To the locals, they're monsters. To the corporate owners of the island, an opportunity. To the team of three sent to study them, a revelation. Their minds are unlike ours. Their bodies are malleable, transformable, shifting. They can communicate. And they want us to leave. When pioneering marine biologist Dr. Ha Nguyen is offered the chance to travel to the remote Con Dao Archipelago to investigate a highly intelligent, dangerous octopus species, she doesn't pause long enough to look at the fine print. DIANIMA- a transnational tech corporation best known for its groundbreaking work in artificial intelligence - has purchased the islands, evacuated their population and sealed the archipelago off from the world so that Nguyen can focus on her research. But the stakes are high: the octopuses hold the key to unprecedented breakthroughs in extrahuman intelligence and there are vast fortunes to be made by whoever can take advantage of their advancements. And no one has yet asked the octopuses what they think. And what they might do about it.",2023-02-01,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction', '', 'sciencefiction', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'sciencefiction', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'earthsciences', 'geography', 'environment', 'planning', 'theenvironment', 'conservationoftheenvironment']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-mountain-in-the-sea/ray-nayler/9781399600460,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/3996/9781399600460.jpg

When builders renovating a cafe in King's Lynn find a human skeleton behind a wall, they call for DCI Harry Nelson and Dr Ruth Galloway, Head of Archaeology at the nearby University of North Norfolk. Ruth is preoccupied with the threatened closure of her department and by her ever-complicated relationship with Nelson. However, she agrees to look at the case. Ruth sees at once that the bones are modern. They are identified as the remains of Emily Pickering, a young archaeology student who went missing in the 1990s. Emily attended a course run by her Cambridge tutor. Suspicion falls on him and also on another course member - Ruth's friend Cathbad, who is still frail following his near death from Covid. As they investigate, Nelson and his team uncover a tangled web of relationships within the student group and the adults leading them. What was the link between the group and the King's Lynn cafe where Emily's bones were found? Then, just when the team seem to be making progress, Cathbad disappears.

"Love, Pamela: Her new memoir, taking control of her own narrative for the first time (Hardback)",Pamela Anderson,"'To live and dream is a wicked dance. My dreams often come true - A curse, and a blessing. Pamela Anderson's blond bombshell image was ubiquitous in the 1990s. Discovered in the stands during a Canadian football game, she was quickly launched into superstardom, becoming Playboy's favourite cover girl and an emblem of Hollywood glamour and sex appeal. Yet the Pamela Anderson we think we know was created through happenstance rather than careful cultivation. Love, Pamela brings forth her true story, that of a small town girl getting tangled up in her own dreams. Growing up on Vancouver Island, the daughter of young, wild, and unwittingly stylish parents, Pamela lived a hardscrabble childhood but developed a deep love for nature, populating her world with misfits, apparitional friends, and injured animals. Eventually overcoming her natural shyness, Pamela let her restless imagination propel her into a life few can dream of, in Hollywood and the Playboy Mansion. As her star rose, she found herself becoming a fixture of tabloid fodder, at the height of an era when paparazzi tactics were bent on destroying a person's image and self-esteem. Pamela forged ahead with grace, finding sanctuary in her love of art and literature, and emerged a devoted mother and activist. Now, having returned to the island of her childhood, after a memorable run starring as Roxie in Chicago on Broadway, Pamela is telling her story, a story of an irrepressible free spirit coming home and discovering herself anew at every turn. With vivid prose interspersed with bursts of original poetry, Love, Pamela is a pensive, layered, and unforgettable memoir.",2023-01-31,"['biography', 'truestories', 'arts', 'entertainmentbiographies', 'arts', 'entertainmentautobiographies', '', 'entertainment', 'film', 'tv', 'radio', 'individualactors', 'performers', 'biography', 'truestories', 'generalbiography', 'generalautobiography']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/love-pamela/pamela-anderson/9781472291103,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/4722/9781472291103.jpg

They Call It Love: The Politics of Emotional Life (Hardback),Alva Gotby,"Comforting a family member or friend, soothing children, providing company for the elderly, ensuring that people feel well enough to work; this is all essential labour. Without it, capitalism would cease to function. They Call It Love investigates the work that makes a haven in a heartless world, examining who performs this labour, how it is organised, and how it might change. In this groundbreaking book, Alva Gotby calls this work 'emotional reproduction', unveiling its inherently political nature. It not only ensures people's well-being but creates sentimental attachments to social hierarchy and the status quo. Drawing on the thought of the feminist movement Wages for Housework, Gotby demonstrates that emotion is a key element of capitalist reproduction.

Diving Into Heavy Metal! (Paperback),Philip Kerr,"Everybody knows somebody who is a heavy metal fan - fact! If you are already a fan, our hats off to you. If not, let Philip Kerr be your guide as he takes you back through his life and shows how metal has shaped and enhanced every bit. Diving into Heavy Metal! is a journey of discovery, beginning with Philip as a naive child who found himself transfixed by an incredible sound. There tends to be a misrepresentation of heavy metal fans as weird misfits, and many books and films lampoon the subject. Not so in Philip's book as he invites the reader into the story of a community of fans across the world joined by their love of this extraordinary music. Many aspects of metal are covered as Philip discovers them on his journey: heavy metal, thrash metal, glam metal and more. He'll show you some of the more major events in music history, take you to a Sabbat gig in Derby, to see Guns N' Roses in Manchester, to the Clash of the Titans at the Birmingham NEC, and to the artillery barrage otherwise known as Motörhead! He'll also shed light on some of the murkier parts of the scene as he delves into the world of death metal. Whether you're a long-time fan, a recent initiate or a complete newbie, Diving into Heavy Metal! has something for everyone. And while the narrative bursts with humour and passion, it's also above all an honest look at this music that so many fans centre their lives around and without which, Philip says, he isn't sure where he'd be!",2023-01-28,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/diving-into-heavy-metal/9781803135502,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8031/9781803135502.jpg

The Holocaust: An Unfinished History - Pelican Books (Hardback),Dan Stone,"An authoritative, revelatory new history of the Holocaust, from one of the leading scholars of his generationThe Holocaust is much-discussed, much-memorialized and much-portrayed. But there are major aspects of its history that have been overlooked. Spanning the entirety of the Holocaust and across the world, this sweeping history deepens our understanding. Dan Stone reveals how the idea of 'industrial murder' is incomplete: many were killed where they lived in the most brutal of ways. He outlines the depth of collaboration across Europe, arguing persuasively that we need to stop thinking of the Holocaust as an exclusively German project. He also considers the nature of trauma the Holocaust engendered, and why Jewish suffering has yet to be fully reckoned with. And he makes clear that the kernel to understanding Nazi thinking and action is genocidal ideology, providing a deep analysis of its origins. Drawing on decades of research, The Holocaust: An Unfinished History upends much of what we think we know about the Holocaust. Stone draws on Nazi documents, but also on diaries, post-war testimonies and even fiction, urging that, in our age of increasing nationalism and xenophobia, we must understand the true history of the Holocaust.",2023-01-26,"['history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'genocide', 'ethniccleansing', 'theholocaust', '', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'europe', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'politics', 'government', 'politicalideologies', 'fascism', 'nazism']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-holocaust/dan-stone/9780241388709,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2413/9780241388709.jpg
"Pirate Enlightenment, or the Real Libertalia (Hardback)",David Graeber,"The Enlightenment did not begin in Europe. Its true origins lie thousands of miles away on the island of Madagascar, in the late seventeenth century, when it was home to several thousand pirates. This was the Golden Age of Piracy, a period of violent buccaneering and rollicking legends - but it was also, argues anthropologist David Graeber, a brief window of radical democracy, as the pirate settlers attempted to apply the egalitarian principles of their ships to a new society on land. For Graeber, Madagascar's lost pirate utopia represents some of the first stirrings of Enlightenment political thought. In this jewel of a book, he offers a way to 'decolonize the Enlightenment', demonstrating how this mixed community experimented with an alternative vision of human freedom, far from that being formulated in the salons and coffee houses of Europe. Its actors were Malagasy women, merchants and traders, philosopher kings and escaped slaves, exploring ideas that were ultimately to be put into practice by Western revolutionary regimes a century later. Pirate Enlightenment playfully dismantles the central myths of the Enlightenment. In their place comes a story about the magic, sea battles, purloined princesses, manhunts, make-believe kingdoms, fraudulent ambassadors, spies, jewel thieves, poisoners and devil worship that lie at the origins of modern freedom.",2023-01-26,"['history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory', '', 'history', 'historicalperiods', 'modernhistory:1700to1900', 'spirituality', 'beliefs', 'philosophy', 'historyofwesternphilosophy', 'enlightenment']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/pirate-enlightenment-or-the-real-libertalia/david-graeber/9780241611401,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2416/9780241611401.jpg
If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal: What Animal Intelligence Reveals About Human Stupidity (Hardback),Justin Gregg,"What if human intelligence is actually more of a liability than a gift? After all, the animal kingdom, in all its diversity, gets by just fine without it. At first glance, human history is full of remarkable feats of intelligence, yet human exceptionalism can be a double-edged sword. With our unique cognitive prowess comes severe consequences, including existential angst, violence, discrimination, and the creation of a world teetering towards climate catastrophe. What if human exceptionalism is more of a curse than a blessing? As Justin Gregg puts it, there's an evolutionary reason why human intelligence isn't more prevalent in the animal kingdom. Simply put, non-human animals don't need it to be successful. And, miraculously, their success arrives without the added baggage of destroying themselves and the planet in the process. In seven mind-bending and hilarious chapters, Gregg highlights features seemingly unique to humans - our use of language, our rationality, our moral systems, our so-called sophisticated consciousness - and compares them to our animal brethren. What emerges is both demystifying and remarkable, and will change how you look at animals, humans, and the meaning of life itself.",2023-01-26,"['popularscience', 'nature', 'popularscience', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'ethicalissues', 'debates', 'scientific', 'technologicaldevelopments', 'popularscience', 'nature', 'naturewriting', 'wildlife']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/if-nietzsche-were-a-narwhal/justin-gregg/9781399712460,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/3997/9781399712460.jpg

Determined to get away from the dead-end town where she grew up, determined to make a place for herself in high society and determined to reach the top of the career ladder. And she doesn't care how many lives she ruins in the process. Set in 90s tabloid era London, Becky charts the rise and fall of a very modern heroine as she inveigles her way into the highest society, where tabloid millionaires mingle and trade favours and fortunes with royalty and aristocracy, pushes her way up through the ranks at the Mercury newspaper with manipulative scoop after scoop, and eventually orchestrates her own dramatic downfall. These are some of the biggest news stories and scandals of the last few decades, and Becky seems to have something to do with every one of them...

The Hero of This Book (Hardback),Elizabeth McCracken,"Ten months after her mother's death, the narrator of The Hero of This Book walks across London on a quiet Sunday. The city was a favourite of her mother's, and as the narrator wanders the streets, she finds herself reflecting on her mother's life and their relationship. Thoughts of the past meld with questions of the future: back in New England, the family home is now up for sale, its considerable contents already winnowed. The woman, a writer, recalls all that made her complicated mother extraordinary - her brilliant wit, her generosity, her unbelievable obstinacy, her sheer will in seizing life despite physical difficulties - and finds herself wondering how her mother had endured. Even though she wants to respect her mother's nearly pathological sense of privacy, the woman must come to terms with whether making a chronicle of this remarkable life constitutes an act of love or betrayal. The Hero of This Book is a searing examination of grief and renewal, and of a deeply felt relationship between a child and her parents. At once comic and heartbreaking, with prose that surprises at every turn, this is a novel of such piercing love and tenderness that we are reminded that art is what remains when all else falls away.",2023-01-26,"['fiction', 'modern', 'contemporaryfiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-hero-of-this-book/elizabeth-mccracken/9781787334281,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7873/9781787334281.jpg

The son of expat parents in colonial Nigeria, Ed was sent back to Britain to be educated by Benedictine monks at Ampleforth, at the time when, it was latter revealed, the school and monastery were the setting for serial abuse cases. He then went up to Cambridge, where his life as an undergraduate gave him access to a network of future ministers, judges and newspaper editors. As a young journalist, he reported first from party conferences and picket lines and then from war zones, witnessing the events making international headlines, from Haiti to Hong Kong, before returning home to join the infighting on BBC Radio 4's Today.

One Hundred Saturdays: Stella Levi and the Vanished World of Jewish Rhodes (Hardback),Michael Frank,"'Having the last word can be very lonely.' Nearly a century of life behind her, Stella Levi had never shared the full details of her past with anyone. That is until she met Michael Frank, and asked him to help her polish a talk she was to give about life in the Juderia of Rhodes. Neither of them could know that this was the first of one hundred Saturdays that they would spend in each other's company. Courageous and sharp, elegant and sly, Stella is a formidable modern Scheherazade whose Saturday instalments give a window into the vibrant, vanished world of the Jews of Rhodes. She unspools for the first time the long threads of her history - from the sun-soaked shores of her childhood, to the fifteen harrowing months she spent in camps scattered throughout Europe, and finally to the United States and New York as one of only 150 Jews from Rhodes to survive. Featuring colour illustrations based on Stella's family photographs, One Hundred Saturdays is an unusual and extraordinary memoir. It is a testament to the soul-saving power of relationships; to memories revisited; to resilience. It's not only a vital slice of history that has largely been ignored, but a story of the possibility of an ever-evolving self, even after confronting Hell.",2023-01-26,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'genocide', 'ethniccleansing', 'theholocaust']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/one-hundred-saturdays/michael-frank/maira-kalman/9781800815377,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/8008/9781800815377.jpg
I'm Black So You Don't Have to Be: A Memoir in Eight Lives (Hardback),Colin Grant,"'I'm black, so you don't have to be,' Colin Grant's uncle Castus used to tell him. For Colin, born in Britain to Jamaican parents, things were supposed to be different. If he worked hard and became a doctor, he was told, his race would become invisible; he would shake off the burden he believed his parents' generation had carried. The reality turned out to be very different. This is a memoir told through a series of intimate intergenerational portraits. We meet Grant's mother Ethlyn, disappointed by working-class life in Luton, who dreams of returning to Jamaica; his father Bageye, a maverick and small-time ganja dealer with a violent temper; his sister Selma, who refashioned herself as an African princess; his great uncle Percy, estranged from his family through his own pride.

Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time (Hardback),Sheila Liming,"A smart and empowering book about the simple art of hanging out ... and of taking back our social lives from the deadening whirl of contemporary life. Almost every day it seems that our world becomes more fractured, more digital, and more chaotic. Sheila Liming has the answer: we need to hang out more. Starting with the assumption that play is to children as hanging out is to adults, Liming makes a brilliant case for the necessity of unstructured social time as a key element of our cultural vitality. The book asks questions like what is hanging out? Why is it important? Why do we do it? How do we do it? And examines the various ways we hang out—in groups, online, at parties, at work. Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time makes an intelligent case for the importance of this most casual of social structures, and shows us how just getting together can be a potent act of resistance all on its own.",2023-01-26,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/hanging-out/sheila-liming/9781685890056,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/6858/9781685890056.jpg

What was the most dangerous part of a chariot race? How could a wolf help with toothache? Take a gallop into the Roman world of chariot horses, battle elephants and rampaging rhinos.

Adventurers: The Improbable Rise of the East India Company: 1550-1650 (Hardback),David Howarth,"The unlikely beginnings of the East India Company-from Tudor origins and rivalry with the superior Dutch-to laying the groundwork for future British expansion The East India Company was the largest commercial enterprise in British history, yet its roots in Tudor England are often overlooked. The Tudor revolution in commerce led ambitious merchants to search for new forms of investment, not least in risky overseas enterprises-and for these ""adventurers"" the most profitable bet of all would be on the Company. Through a host of stories and fascinating details, David Howarth brings to life the Company's way of doing business-from the leaky ships and petty seafarers of its embattled early days to later sweeping commercial success. While the Company's efforts met with disappointment in Japan, they sowed the seeds of success in India, setting the outline for what would later become the Raj. Drawing on an abundance of sources, Howarth shows how competition from European powers was vital to success-and considers whether the Company was truly ""English"" at all, or rather part of a Europe-wide movement.",2023-01-24,"['history', 'general', 'worldhistory', '', 'history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'britain', 'ireland', 'history', 'historicalperiods', 'earlymodernhistory:1500to1700']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/adventurers/david-howarth/9780300250725,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/3002/9780300250725.jpg
Parasites: The Inside Story (Hardback),Scott Lyell Gardner,"An exciting look at the essential roles that parasites play in Earth's ecosystems. This book looks at the weird and wonderful world of parasites, the most abundant form of life on Earth. Parasites come in all forms and sizes and inhabit every free-living organism. Parasitism is now, and always has been, a way to survive under changing environmental conditions. From arctic oceans to tropical forests, Scott Gardner, Judy Diamond, and Gabor Racz investigate how parasites survive and evolve, and how they influence and provide stability to ecosystems. Taking readers to the open ranges of Mongolia, the Sandhills of north-central Nebraska, the Andes of Bolivia, and more, the authors examine the impact parasites have on humans and other animals. Using examples of parasites from throughout the tree of life, the authors describe parasite-host relationships as diverse as those between trematodes and snails and tapeworms and whales. They even consider the strange effects of thorny-headed worms on their hosts. Parasites offer clues to the evolutionary history of particular regions, and they can provide insights into the history of species interactions. Through parasites, biologists can weave together a global knowledge of the past to predict the challenges that we will face in the future. Revealing that parasites are so much more than creepy-crawlies, this book gives up-to-date context for these critical members of the biological diversity of our planet.",2023-01-24,"['science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'mathematics', 'science', 'biology/lifesciences', 'zoology', 'animalsciences']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/parasites/scott-lyell-gardner/judy-diamond/9780691206875,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/6912/9780691206875.jpg

A Winter Grave (Hardback),Peter May,"It is the year 2051. Warnings of climate catastrophe have been ignored, and vast areas of the planet are under water, or uninhabitably hot. A quarter of the world's population has been displaced by hunger and flooding, and immigration wars are breaking out around the globe as refugees pour into neighbouring countries. By contrast, melting ice sheets have brought the Gulf Stream to a halt and northern latitudes, including Scotland, are being hit by snow and ice storms. It is against this backdrop that Addie, a young meteorologist checking a mountain top weather station, discovers the body of a man entombed in ice. The dead man is investigative reporter, George Younger, missing for three months after vanishing during what he claimed was a hill-walking holiday. But Younger was no hill walker, and his discovery on a mountain-top near the Highland village of Kinlochleven, is inexplicable. Cameron Brodie, a veteran Glasgow detective, volunteers to be flown north to investigate Younger's death, but he has more than a murder enquiry on his agenda. He has just been given a devastating medical prognosis by his doctor and knows the time has come to face his estranged daughter who has made her home in the remote Highland village. Arriving during an ice storm, Brodie and pathologist Dr. Sita Roy, find themselves the sole guests at the inappropriately named International Hotel, where Younger's body has been kept refrigerated in a cake cabinet. But evidence uncovered during his autopsy places the lives of both Brodie and Roy in extreme jeopardy. As another storm closes off communications and the possibility of escape, Brodie must face up not only to the ghosts of his past, but to a killer determined to bury forever the chilling secret that George Younger's investigations had threatened to expose.

The Road: A Story of Romans and Ways to the Past (Hardback),Christopher Hadley,"Have you ever heard the march of legions on a lonely country road? For two thousand years, the roads the Romans built have determined the flow of ideas and folktales, where battles were fought and where pilgrims trod. Almost everyone in Britain lives close to a Roman road, if only we knew where to look. In the beginning was Watling Street, the first road scored on the land when the invading Romans arrived on a cold and alien Kentish shore in 43 CE. Campaign roads rolled out to all points of the compass, forcing their way inland and as the Britons fell back, the roads pursued them relentlessly, carrying troops, supplies and military despatches. In the years of fighting that followed, as the legions pushed onwards across what is now England, into Wales and north into Scotland in search of booty, mineral wealth, land and tribute, they left behind a vast road network, linking marching camps and forts, changing the landscape, etching the story of the Roman advance into the face of the land, channelling our lives today. Christopher Hadley, acclaimed author of Hollow Places, takes us on a lyrical journey into this past, retracing and searching for an elusive Roman road that sprang from one of the busiest road hubs in Roman Britain. His passage is not always easy. Time and nature have erased many clues; bridges rotted and whole woods grew across the route. Carters found an easier ford downstream, and people broke up its milestones to mend new paths. Year after year the heavy clay swallowed whole lengths of it; the once mighty road became a bridleway, an overgrown hollow-way, a parched mark in the soil. Hadley leads us on a hunt to discover, in Hilaire Belloc's phrase, 'all that has arisen along the way'. Gathering traces of archaeology, history and landscape from poems, church walls, hag stones and cropmarks, oxlips, killing places, hauntings and immortals, and things buried too deep for archaeology, The Road is a mesmerising journey into two thousand years of history only now giving up its secrets.",2023-01-19,"['history', 'regional', 'nationalhistory', 'britain', 'ireland', '', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'social', 'culturalhistory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-road/christopher-hadley/9780008356699,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/0083/9780008356699.jpg

On Savage Shores: How Indigenous Americans Discovered Europe (Hardback),Caroline Dodds Pennock,"We have long been taught to presume that modern global history began when the 'Old World' encountered the 'New', when Christopher Columbus 'discovered' America in 1492. But, as Caroline Dodds Pennock conclusively shows in this groundbreaking book, for tens of thousands of Aztecs, Maya, Totonacs, Inuit and others - enslaved people, diplomats, explorers, servants, traders - the reverse was true: they discovered Europe. For them, Europe comprised savage shores, a land of riches and marvels, yet perplexing for its brutal disparities of wealth and quality of life, and its baffling beliefs. The story of these Indigenous Americans abroad is a story of abduction, loss, cultural appropriation, and, as they saw it, of apocalypse - a story that has largely been absent from our collective imagination of the times. From the Brazilian king who met Henry VIII to the Aztecs who mocked up human sacrifice at the court of Charles V; from the Inuk baby who was put on show in a London pub to the mestizo children of Spaniards who returned 'home' with their fathers; from the Inuit who harpooned ducks on the Avon river to the many servants employed by Europeans of every rank: here are a people who were rendered exotic, demeaned, and marginalised, but whose worldviews and cultures had a profound impact on European civilisation.

You Are Not Alone (Hardback),Cariad Lloyd,"Inspired by her award-winning podcast, Griefcast, You Are Not Alone is Cariad Lloyd's frank, funny and compassionate exploration of grief. When Cariad Lloyd lost her father at the age of fifteen, people didn't talk about death. Years later, when she created Griefcast, it started a conversation that people didn't realise they needed until it was there, about one of the most significant events in a person's life: its end. In You Are Not Alone, Cariad shares all that she has learned from Griefcast. She reflects on her own grief, the grief of others, and the psychology and science behind how our society deals with death and loss. Funeral thoughts, therapy, coping with anniversaries, bad friends, good friends, birthdays, weddings, missing them, not missing them - this is grief in all its sad, surprising, awkward, tender and sometimes funny forms. You Are Not Alone is a road map for all of us: for anybody who has ever felt lost in grief, who would like to help someone they know through theirs, or who just wants to understand life a little better.",2023-01-19,"['health', 'lifestyle', 'copingwithpersonalproblems', 'death', 'bereavement', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'sociology', 'anthropology', 'sociology', 'customs', 'traditions', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'sociology', 'anthropology', 'sociology', 'death', 'dying']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/you-are-not-alone/cariad-lloyd/9781526621832,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5266/9781526621832.jpg

The Little Girl Who Could Not Cry (Hardback),Lidia Maksymowicz,"The heartbreaking, inspiring true story of a girl sent to Auschwitz who survived the evil Dr Josef Mengele's pseudo-medical experiments. With a foreword by His Holiness Pope Francis. Lidia Maksymowicz was just three years old when she arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau with her mother, grandparents and foster brother. They were from Belarus, their 'crime' that they supported the partisan resistance to Nazi occupation. Once there, Lidia was picked by Mengele for his experiments and sent to the children's block. It was here that she survived eighteen months of hell. Injected with infectious diseases, desperately malnourished, she came close to death. Her mother - who risked her life to secretly visit Lidia - was her only tie to humanity. By the time Birkenau was liberated her family had disappeared. Even her mother was presumed dead. Lidia was adopted by a woman from the nearby town of Oswiecim. Too traumatised to feel emotion, she was not an easy child to care for but she came to love her adoptive mother and her new home. Then, in 1962, she discovered that her birth parents were still alive. The Little Girl Who Could Not Cry is powerful, moving and ultimately hopeful, as Lidia comes to terms with the past and finds the strength to share her story - even making headlines when she meets Pope Francis, who kisses her tattoo. Above all she refuses to hate those who hurt her so badly, saying, 'Hate only brings more hate. Love, on the other hand, has the power to redeem.'",2023-01-19,"['biography', 'truestories', 'generalbiography', 'generalautobiography', '', 'history', 'historicalperiods', '20thcenturyhistory:1900to2000', 'history', 'historicalevents', 'topics', 'genocide', 'ethniccleansing', 'theholocaust']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-little-girl-who-could-not-cry/lidia-maksymowicz/paolo-luigi-rodari/9781529094367,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5290/9781529094367.jpg

Milk: An Intimate History of Breastfeeding (Hardback),Joanna Wolfarth,"When Joanna Wolfarth was pregnant with her first child, she assumed she would breastfeed, as her mother had fed her. Yet she was unprepared for the startling realities of new motherhood. Then, just four weeks after the birth, she found herself back in hospital with an underweight baby, bewildered by inconsistent advice and overcome with feelings of guilt and isolation. Months later, her cultural historian's impulse led her to look to the past for guidance. What she discovered, neglected in the archives, amazed and reassured her. By piecing together cultural debris - from fragments of ancient baby bottles to eighteenth-century breast pumps, from the Palaeolithic Woman of Willendorf figurine to the poignantly inventive work of Louise Bourgeois and from mythical accounts of the creation of the Milky Way to advice found in Victorian medical manuals - Joanna began to understand how feeding our babies can be culturally, economically and physiologically determined as well as deeply personal and emotive. Using the arc of her own experience, Joanna takes us on an intimate journey of discovery beyond mother and baby, asking how the world views caregivers, their bodies, their labour and their communal bonds. By bringing together art, social histories, philosophy, folk wisdom and contemporary interviews with women from across the world, Milk reveals how infant feeding has been represented and repressed, celebrated and censured.

The Half Known Life: Finding Paradise in a Divided World (Hardback),Pico Iyer,"One of our most perceptive travel writers embarks on an exploration of the world's holiest places and where we might find paradise on Earth.  It's so easy, I thought, to place Paradise in the past or the future - anywhere but here.' After half a century of travel, from Ethiopia to Tibet, from Belfast to Jerusalem, Pico Iyer asks himself what kind of paradise can ever be found in a world of unceasing conflict. In a spectacular journey, both inward and outward, Iyer roams from crowded mosques in Iran to a film studio in North Korea, from a holy mountain in Japan to the sometimes spooky emptiness of the Australian outback. At every stop, he makes connections with unexpected strangers - mystics and taxi drivers and fellow travellers - and draws on his own memories, of time spent in a Benedictine monastery high above the Pacific, of regular travels with the Dalai Lama, of hearing his late mother speak of sunlit moments in pre-Partition India. By the end, he has upended many of our expectations and dared to suggest that we can find paradise right in the heart of our angry, confused and divided world.",2023-01-19,"['poetry', 'drama', 'criticism', 'prose:non-fiction']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-half-known-life/pico-iyer/9781526655011,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5266/9781526655011.jpg

A Girlhood: A Letter to My Transgender Daughter (Hardback),Carolyn Hays,"When Carolyn Hays's child made clear to the family that they were all wrong, he was not a boy, but, in fact, a girl, the Hays shifted pronouns, adopted a nickname and encouraged her to dress as she felt comfortable. One ordinary day, a caseworker from the Department of Children and Families knocked on their door to investigate an anonymous complaint about the upbringing of their transgender child. It was this threat that instilled in them a deep-seated fear for their child's safety in the Republican state they called home. And so they uprooted their lives to the more trans-accepting Northeast United States, though they were never far from the hate and fear resting at the nation's core. Intimate, lyrical and thought-provoking, A Girlhood is an ode to Hays's brilliant, brave child, as well as a cathartic revisit of the pain of the past. It tells of the brutal truths of being trans, of the sacrificial nature of motherhood, and of the lengths a family will go to shield their youngest from the cruel realities of the world. Hays asks us all to love better, for children everywhere enduring injustice and prejudice just as they begin to understand themselves. A Girlhood is a celebration of difference, a plea for empathy, a hope for a better future, but moreover, it is a love letter to a child who has always known herself and is waiting for the rest of the world to catch up.",2023-01-19,"['biography', 'truestories', 'memoirs', '', 'politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialgroups', 'genderstudies', 'business', 'finance', 'law', 'law', 'jurisprudence', 'generalissues', 'gender', 'thelaw']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/a-girlhood/carolyn-hays/9781529064483,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/5290/9781529064483.jpg

The Wife of Bath: A Biography (Hardback),Marion Turner,"From the award-winning biographer of Chaucer, the story of his most popular and scandalous character, from the Middle Ages to #MeToo Ever since her triumphant debut in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the Wife of Bath, arguably the first ordinary and recognisably real woman in English literature, has obsessed readers-from Shakespeare to James Joyce, Voltaire to Pasolini, Dryden to Zadie Smith. Few literary characters have led such colourful lives or matched her influence or capacity for reinvention in poetry, drama, fiction, and film. In The Wife of Bath, Marion Turner tells the fascinating story of where Chaucer's favourite character came from, how she related to real medieval women, and where her many travels have taken her since the fourteenth century, from Falstaff and Molly Bloom to #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. A sexually active and funny working woman, the Wife of Bath, also known as Alison, talks explicitly about sexual pleasure. She is also a victim of domestic abuse who tells a story of rape and redemption. Formed from misogynist sources, she plays with stereotypes. Turner sets Alison's fictional story alongside the lives of real medieval women-from a maid who travelled around Europe, abandoned her employer, and forged a new career in Rome to a duchess who married her fourth husband, a teenager, when she was sixty-five. Turner also tells the incredible story of Alison's post-medieval life, from seventeenth-century ballads and Polish communist pop art to her reclamation by postcolonial Black British women writers.Entertaining and enlightening, funny and provocative, The Wife of Bath is a one-of-a-kind history of a literary and feminist icon who continues to capture the imagination of readers.",2023-01-17,"['politics', 'society', 'education', 'society', 'culture', 'socialissues', 'processes', 'feminism', 'feministtheory']",https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-wife-of-bath/marion-turner/9780691206011,https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/6912/9780691206011.jpg

Maya once saw this cabin as an idyllic place, like a cottage from a fairy tale, but now she knows the danger that lurks beneath. The summer she visited the cabin was the summer her best friend Aubrey died. Now, another woman from Maya's hometown has died in the same strange, unexplained way, and Maya believes only she can save the next innocent girl.

"A Silent Fire: The Story of Inflammation, Diet and Disease (Hardback)",Shilpa Ravella,"A Silent Fire is a captivating expert account of inflammation's hidden role in many of the diseases of modernity and what we can actually do about it. Inflammation is the body's response to injury and foreign microbes. But what if it were also a potential root cause of modern disease? The swelling and soreness of inflammation are caused by the gathering of immune cells to defend and heal our bodies. But as our environments and diets have rapidly changed, new science suggests that our immune systems are increasingly turning against us. Low-level inflammation, simmering quietly and undetected, has recently been identified behind everything from heart disease and cancer to mysterious autoimmune conditions. Hidden inflammation even weakens our immunity and increases the likelihood that our immune system will mount an overwhelming, inappropriate attack against infections. Shilpa Ravella is a specialist doctor at the forefront of this field, working on rare inflammatory disorders, gut transplants, nutrition and the microbiome. In A Silent Fire she interweaves the latest research with unusual case studies from her own practice and the history of immunology to explain what we know about this elusive phenomenon. She also debunks common myths about 'anti-inflammatory' lifestyles and reveals how we can reform our relationships with food and our microbiomes to benefit our own health and the planet's. In the eyes of many experts, inflammation is emerging as a common root of the diseases of modernity.
